### Graphs

Graph is a finite set of nodes with edges between nodes.



1) Maximum Flow (Video 1)

Spanning Tree:
2) - Kruskal's algorithm

3) - Prim's algorithm

4-7) Hamiltonian tour vs Eularian Tours

8-10) Postorder depth (use The algorithm discussed in class for finding strongly connected components)
