### Termed Floyd's method

The advantages come from the fact that a node can only be shifted to a leaf and ost of the nodes are close to a leaf

In the tests I ran, it was about 1/3 the time of just inserting n times (So same complexity, but different constants).


### Null Path length

Smallest number of nodes between it and a node with a null child in the tree.


- npl(null) = -1
- npl(leaf) = 0
- npl(single-child node) = 0
