### Check if BST form matches

```java
boolean match(Node<E> t1, Node<E> t2) {
  if (t1 == null && t2 == null) {
    return true;
  }

  if (t1 == null || t2 == null) {
    return false;
  }

  return t1.val.compareTo(t2.val) == 0 &&
  match(t1.left, t2.left) &&
  match(t1.right, t2.right);
}
```

### AVL trees

Nodes need to keep track of their height. You can iterate through your tree to find height when needed but this is a lot of overhead and takes away from the point of using a data structure like BST.

A tree is unbalanced when the height of two child nodes is different by a value greater than 1. When unhappy, we rotate

Single Rotation case: (linear)
```
   0
    \
     0
      \
       0
```

Double Rotation case: (zigzag)
```
   0
    \
     0
    /
   0
```


Rotation Example:
```   
      10                                     15
     /  \                                  /    \
    8    15                              10      20
        /  \            -->             /  \       \
       12   20                         8   12       30
              \
               30      
```

Rotates to:
