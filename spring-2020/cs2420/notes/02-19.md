### Assignment 4: Hashing

Most the code is already given to you. You will not have to write hashing from scratch.

Modify so declarations take two arguments.

Test the code.

Part 2 of assignment: Create Poetry

Store each word in a hash table as the key and then it will have values for each word that occurs after that word in the poem.

We will then generate a poem by using a starting word provided to us and then determine generate a random number between 1 and the count of the words that occur after our word and then select the word based on our probability.

```java

public static class Freq{
  String follow;
  int followCt;
  public Freq(String follow, int ct) {
    this.follow = follow;
    this.followCt = ct;
  }

  
}
```
