2nd Exam is next week. Do assignment 5 before the test if possible.

### Assignment 5

Will be provided events with a start time, a deadline time and the amount of time it takes.

- Sorted by start time

To prioritize items you may consider adding start and duration time and subtract that from deadline to determine how much time you have and prioritize tasks that you have less time to complete.


### Priority Queues (cont.)
- leftist
- skew
- array

#### Binomial Queues

Always heavy to the right.

New nodes create their own heap or append to a separate heap until it is the same size as our original heap. Once the same size, one heap is added as a child of the other (Depending on which root is smaller).

Complexity: Worst case is log(n). Best Case: 1

If you have three trees of the same size, you it doesnt matter which two you merge.
