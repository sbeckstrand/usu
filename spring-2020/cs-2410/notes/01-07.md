### Java Review

Java became popular because it was cross-platform. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems who was later bought by Oracle.



##### JDK - Java Developer Kit

##### JRE - Java Runtime Environment.

##### JVM - Java Virtual Machine.
Application runs in a VM, that way it can run on any system that supports the VM. Removes unreferenced objects.

Generics are safer than general polymorphism as Generics are checked at compile time instead of runtime.

```Java
class Review {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    // Array Declaration
    int[] data = {50,25,30,25};

    int data2;
    data2 = new int[] {50,25,30,25};


    // Try/Catch/Finally
    try {
      System.out.println("Something");
    }
    catch (<Exception type> <Exception variable){

    }
    // Any noncaught exceptions will result in 'finally' code block being executed.
    finally {

    }
  }
}
```

Final = declare constant
Finally = Required end of try:catch
Finalize =

Code should be decoupled from other methods/classes

##### Mean Reversion

You trust the average more than current value.
