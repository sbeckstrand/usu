In Java, if you do not include a constructor, a default constructor is made.

When you have a class in a class, its called an inner-class.

Anonymous Class = Creating an object using a class but not assigning it a reference. You can also create inner classes anonymously.

Lamda = Function object - An anonymous inner class that we use or its functionality.

You can call the constructor of a specific parent class using 'Super'. It needs to be defined on the first line.
