PasswordField: Node type in JavaFX.
- Hides content of field.


#### Bindings, Events, Listeners review

All of them are sending and receiving data from the GUI thread to/from the server thread

##### Bindings

Bindings are simply a wrapper.

```
[Property 1]<--- Bind() --->[Property 2]
```

Bidirectional Bind - Used for cycles.

Can be used to bind Nodes to a location on a pane. For example, you can find an element to a width and height.

##### Events

When something happens on the gui (event), execute some logic. For example, if you have a password field, if you hit enter, that is the event that triggers some logic to occur .

The event is then handled with an event handler.

EventHander is passed to GUI thread via lambda

```
EventHandler {
  // logic to
  change the password
}
```

##### Listeners

Actively listens where an event requires some type of trigger. Listeners = Active where events are passive.

Listeners will listen to a property.

Anything you can do with a binding, you can do with a listener.
```
Listener {
  // Logic
}
```




#### In Class Exercise:

Need a Label, ____


Start with Bindings

add Listener

Create event
