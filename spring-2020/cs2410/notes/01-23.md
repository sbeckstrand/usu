### Announcements

Homework is due in 8 days (01/31)

We are done with Java review. Moving on to GUIs

### Homework 2

##### Exercise 1 - Polymorphism

Need a parent class named Shape with 4 children classes:
- Square
- Cube
- Triangle
- Pyramid

Each child class should have a method called `getArea()`


#### Exercise 2 - JavaFx

Hello World JavaFX GUI program.
- must extend Application and implement start method
- Class should have 4 layers: stage, scene, pane and text
- Hello and World should be different colors


### Chapter 14 - JavaFX vs Swing and AWT

##### AWT - Abstract Windows Toolkit
- Prone to platform-specific bugs
- Fine for simple GUIS but not for larger, comprehensive GUIs
- Implements native operating system libraries (theming) which was not available in swing.


##### JavaFx
- Benefitted from being able to address issues seen with Swing and AWT


##### Swing
- No longer being supported



### Basic Structure of JavaFX

```java
public class MyJavaFX extends Application {
  @Override
  public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
    Button btOK = new Button("OK");
    Scene scene = new Scene(btOK, 200, 250);
    primaryStage.setTitle("MyJavaFX");
    primaryStage.setScene(scene);
    primaryStage.show();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Application.launch(args);
  }
}
```

##### layers

- Stage
- Scene
- Node Layers (Bunch of types)
  - Pane

###### Border Pane
- Has regions
  - Top
  - Bottom
  - Left
  - Right
  - Center (Meat and potatoes of the GUI)

### $PATH
- OS specific env variable $PATH
- User specific env variable $PATH
- Java class $PATH
  - Path to all the things necessary to run your application.


### Scene Graph
Logical Strucuture for GUI.

It keeps track
