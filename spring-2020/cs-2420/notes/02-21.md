### hashing

Comes down to trading space (memory) for time as hash tables allow us to find values quicker.

Find Position

```java
private int findPos(E x) {
  int offset = 1;
  int currentPos = myHash(x);

  while (array[ currentPos ] != null && !array[currentPos].element.equals(x)) {
    currentPos += offset
    offset += 2;
    if (currentPos >= array.length) {
      currentPos -= array.length;
    }
  }

  return currentPos;
}
```

Rehash
```java

private void rehash() {
  HashEntry<E>[] oldArray = array;

  // Create new double-sized empty
  allocateArray(2 * oldArray.length);
  int occupiedCt = 0;
  int entries = 0;

  // Copy Table Over
}
```

Inserting

```java

public boolean insert(E x) {
  // Insert x as currentActive
  int currentPos = findPos(x); // Looks for an empty slot
  if (isActive(currentPos)) {
    return false;
  }

  array[currentPos] = new HashEntry<>(x, true);
  currentActiveEntries++;

  // rehash; see Section 5.5
  if (++occupiedCt > array.length / 2) {
    rehash();
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Rehashing

When you rehash, you make the table twice as big.

You rehash when the table is too full (load factor)


### Cuckoo Hashing

|Key|Hash 1| Hash2|
|--|--|--|
|5|5|5|
|53|15|2|
|35|16|5|
|56|18|11|
|92|16|8|
|15|15|0|
|62|5|8|
|73|16|7|
|55|17|10|
|142|9|13|
|11|11|11|
|93|17|12|


Advantages:
- Worst-case constant lookup and deletion times
- the avoidance of lazy deletion and extra data
- The potential for parallelism
- The insertion time is expected to be constant time as lon gas the load factor is below 50%

### Chained Hashing

(Zoned out here, gotta look this up)

## Priority Queues (Sometimes known as heaps)

Examples of Priority Queue use
- Ordering CPU jobs
- Searching for the exit in a maze (or looking for moves in the rotation puzzle game)
- Emergency Room Admission Processing

Goals:
- short jobs **should go first**
- most promising nodes **should be searched first**
- most urgent cases **should go first**
- Anything *greedy*

### Min Tree

Every Node is smaller than its kids

depth is always O(log n); next open location always known

Stored as an array (does each Node in the array has a reference to two children and its parent?)

Formulas for references:

- parent(k) = (k - 1) /2 (truncate) OR (k / 2) - 1 (need to round up)
- leftkid(k) = 2k + 1
- rightkid(k) = 2k + 2
