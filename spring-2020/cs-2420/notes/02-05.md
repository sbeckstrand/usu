### B+ Tree (Cont.)

B-Tree of order 5:

- L = 5
- K = 5
- Whole records are stored at the leaves

Requiring nodes to be at least half full guarantees that the B+ tree does not degenerate into a linked list or simple binary tree.

Root does not have to obey the rules.

#### Adding Items

Go down the tree, add it to grand child, If this causes the # of nodes to be above the allowed, we split it in half and then propagate up.


#### Deleting Items

Remove the leaf item, if this causes # of leafs to be below allowed, we pull down the child and combine it with neighbor.

### Hash


| Method| BST| Unordered List| Ordered List |

| Insert| O(log n)| O(1)| O(n)|
| Delete| O(log n)| O(n)| O(n)|
| Find | O(log n)| O(n)| O(log n)|
