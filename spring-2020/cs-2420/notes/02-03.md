#### Is Binary and Balanced (last class exercise)
```java

int isFull(Node<E> t) {
  if (t == null) {
    return 0;
  }
  l = isFull(t.left);
  r = isFull(t.right);

  if (l < 0 || r < 0) {
    return -1;
  }

  if (l == r) {
    return l + 1;
  }

  return -1;
}
```

#### Assignment #3
Due date changed to feb 18

Redoing assignment 1 but with AVL trees.

Will need duplicates

remove minimal from tree since we the lower the score, the better in our assignment.
- write `deleteMin()` method
  - Should find the node and delete it in the same method call


Instead of adding adjacent words to a queue, we are adding them to an AVL tree based on its 'score'. The score represents how close to the target word it is.

We will then take the word with the lowest score, check its adjacent words and if it is our target, you're done. If target not adjacent, add the adjacent words to the tree.

Cant remove words from dictionary as they are checked since we are not adding to a queue in order.

You can track position of when you found word and not allow others to use the word at a lower position

Exam with have a bunch of AVL questions, so it would be helpful to do the assignment before the exam.




#### Exam 1:
Can bring two pages of notes.
Feb 13 or 14


#### B+ Trees

Always completely Balanced

What is controlled in B+ Tree:
- Number of Kids (K)
- Count in Leaf (L)

Road Signs in B+ tree = # Kids (K) - 1

All data is stored in leaf nodes. Everything else acts as road signs.
