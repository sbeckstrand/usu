### Remove item from BST

If you remove a node with 1 child, move it up to its place. If you remove a node with two children, Find the next bigger number and remove it from bottom of tree and replace deleted node.


```java

Node<E> delete(Node<E> t, E item) {
  // If root node is empty, we want to just return before doing anything else.
  if (t == null) {
    return t;
  }

  if (t.value.compareTo(item) > 0 ) {
    t.left = delete(t.left, item);
  }
  else if (t.value.compareTo(item) < 0 ) {
      t.right = delete(t.right, item);
  }

  if (t.left == null) {
    return t.right;
  }

  if (t.right == null) {
    return t.left;
  }

  // 2 kids
  t.val = findMin(t.right);
  t.right = delete(t.right, t.val);
  return t;



}
```

BST - Best Time:

Most operations are O(d) where d is the tree depth

Minimum d is log N for a binary tree with N nodes.

best case running time of BST operations is O(log N)

Complexity to insert to BST is log N


### Approaches to balacing tree:

- Strict Balance (Perfectly balanced)

- Pretty Good (Maybe not perfect but we are not spending more effort/time than its worth to balance).

### AVL Tree ( Adelson-Velsky and Landis)

Idea: Keep tree as balanced as possible at all times. Good but not perfect balancing

AVL trees are height-balanced

Balance factor of a node (height(left-subtree) - height(right subtree))

Height of node:
- null = -1
- bottom = 0

If balance of left and right is different by more than 1, we rotate nodes to balance the tree.

Start from the bottom and rotat at the first 'unhappy' or unbalanced node.

Complexity of rotating:
