#### Check if node is binary (has two children)

```java

boolean isBinary(Node<E> t) {
  if (t == null) return true;

  if (t.left == null && t.right == null) {
    return true;
  }

  if t.left == null || t.right == null {
    return false;
  }

  return isBinary(t.left) && isBinary(t.right);
}
```

#### AVL trees

##### Benefits
- Search is always O(log n) as they are always balanced.
- Insertion and deletions are also O(log n)

##### Cons


#### Splay Trees

Idea: What if you don't keep the tree completely balanced all the time? Instead, on average it will be pretty balanced.

Problems with AVL trees:
- Extra complexity for height fields
- complicated

Solution: Splay Trees
- insert/find always rotates node to the root.
- Worst case time is O(n)
- amortized time for all operations is O(log n)

Moves up two levels at a time.

How does moving to the root help?

Helpful to have a parent value stored in the node.

##### rotations

Has 6 types of rotations

- Single Left rotation
- Single Right Rotation
- Zig-Zig - left -> left || right -> right - Double Rotation (both in same direction)
- Zig-Zag - right -> left || left -> right - Double rotation(One rotation to the left, one rotation to the right.)

If its a binary search tree, it's a splay tree.

#### Splay Tree delete

- Moves the item to the root and then removes it. This leave two separate trees.
- Splay the max in the left subtree or the min of the right tree to the root
- Attach the right subtree to the new node of the left subtree. (or other way around if right was splayed. )
