#### Knapsack Problem

Given a number of items with different weights and value, find the best value of items you can fit in a bag that can hold x weight.

#### Complexity Classes

| Time upper bound |Complexity Type| Problem|
|--|--|--|
| O(1)| Constant| Determine odd/even|
|O(log n)| Logarithmic|Binary Search|
|O(n log n)||Quicksort|
|O(n^2)|Quadratic|Handshaking|
|O(N^3)|Cubic|Matrix Multiply|
|O(2^n)|Exponential|Napsack|
|O(n!)|Factorial| All Paths|

`n^2`
```
for (i --> n):
  for (j --> n):
    j += 1;
```

`n^2 / 2`
```
for (i=0, i --> n):
  for (j=i, i --> n):
    j += j;
```

#### Recursive Complexity

Theorem: T(n) = a(T(n/b)) + O(n^k)
 - a = recursive calls
 - b = at what rate it gets smaller
 - k = Number of loops


#### Asymptotics

Something that is proportional to something else

If something is proportional to N^2 (Running time is cn^2). When n doubles, what happens to time?

cn^2 --> c(2n)^2 --> 4cn^2 --> 4 times longer.
