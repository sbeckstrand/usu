## Pitfalls

Commonly known as 'Code-smells'

## The Uncommunicative Names

Naming variables with generic names or a name that does not communicate what is stored in the variable. 

Example: 
```
let obj = { name: "Billy", age: 30 }
```

Variable clearly stores details about a person but its variable name would not show that. 

Example2: 

```
let person1 = { name: "Alex", age: 30, isProfessor: true }
let person2 = { name: "Billy", age: 22, isProfessor: false }


```
