## Objects

Classes != Objects

## Abstraction

Reveal the important things, supress everything else.

Over-abstraction = doesnt do all the things it should be able to do

Under-abstraction = does more than it should do

Leaky-abstraction = Needing to know information about how the system works that isnt explicitly stated. Such as that a method needs a string without capital letters, etc.
