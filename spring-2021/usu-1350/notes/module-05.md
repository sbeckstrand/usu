## Unifying Concepts

* Evolution 
* Natural Selection
* Adapation

### Evolution

Definition: Change in gene frequency of a population over time in response to the envitronment

**Genotype**: Genetic makeup

**Phenotype**: Physical expression of genotype

Environment is dynamic

### Natural Selection

Definition: 

Populations have genetic variation. Individuals in a population have different genotypes and phenotypes

Individuals will have genetic variation: Height, eye color, skin color, shape, etc. 

Differential reproductive success. 
* Some individuals leave more offspring over time
* Genotype is currency of selection
* Meiosis and mitosis

Enviroment is the selective force on individuals

Competition with conspecifics is mechanism

#### Mitosis

Process of a cell reproducing and having two copies of itself. 

#### Miosis

Sexual reproduction

Half of a male's cell chromosomes are contained in a sperm cell. Half of a female's cell chromosomes are contained in an egg. When the egg incubaters the sperm, they form new cells. 

### Adaptation

Definition: The ability of an individual to be successful relative to the environment
 
 Evolutionary success of individuals in a population is measured by reproductive output

 Measured relative to the environment

 * More output = more fit (better adapted)
 * Less output = less fit (worse adapated)

### Things to remember

Evolution is a fact and a theory

Fact: 
* Facts are data
* Facts are not absolute certainty

Theory: 
* Structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts

Remember - Science is ALWAYS open to revision relative to new informaiton
