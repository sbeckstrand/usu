## Module 03: Energy and Life

**Energy** is the ability to do work / cause change / rearrange a colleciton of matter

Ceels use energy to: 

* Perform mechanical work
* transport ions and other dissolved substances across membranes
* Make large molecules

### Metabolic Pathways

**Anabolic**: Small molecules are built into large ones. Energy is requires

**Catabolic**: Large molecules are broken down into small ones. Energy is released.

### Understanding Energy Flow in Living SYstems

Living systems use energy to maintain themselves

How the Laws of HThermodynamics relate to biology

* energy cannot be created or destroyed
* disorder (entropy) is always increasing

Life converts solar energy to other forms that are used to drive life processes

Much of the sun's energy is converted to heat, or random molecular motion

**Redox reactions**: The way energy is transfered among molecules involves electron transfer

**Oxidation**: Loss of electron

**Reduction** Gain of electron

Energy transfers occur via chemical reactions and Some reactions are more likely to occur than others. 

**Exergonic**: Reactions that release energy. Products contain less energy than reactants

All exergonic reactions do not occur spontaneously. Sometimes, they require a catalyst. These catalysts are called **Enzymes**.

Catalysts can decrease the activation energy of reactions

Key attributes of Enzymes: 

* Protein
* Shape determines activity
* Highly specific 

How Enzymes Work: 

* Bond to substrates (reactants)
* Can lower activation energy by weaking bonds
* They can hold reactants together

How Enzymes are regulated: 

* Feedback inhabitation. Once product is complete, feedback inhibition slos down or stops production

Factors that influence enzyme activity: 

* Coenzymes
* pH
* Temperature

**Endergonic**: Reactions that require energy input. Products contain more energy than reactants

**Adensoine triphosphate (ATP)**

Contains: 

* Ribose - a sugar
* Adenine - a nucleotide
* Phosphates

Phosphates in ATP are key to energy. Each time a phosphate is removed, energy is released

Energy transfers occur via chemical reactions. Cells move energy around a molecule called ATP

Where do cells get the enrgy to make ATP? Through a process called Cellular repsiration

**Cellular respiration**: Usees glucose from our digested food to generate the enrgy storage molecule ATP

Overall reaction for cellular respiration: 

Glucose + Oxygen --> Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy

Cellular respiration involves many checmical reactions: 

1) Glycolysis

2) Krebs cycle

3) Electron transport chain
