Tips:

Some questions have multiple answers
Read questions slowly

#### What is Science?

Science is used to answer specific questions about the world. 

We do that by forming hyptoheses or predictions

Does not tell us how to morally or ethically behave

It is not a collection of facts

#### 8 Characteristics of Life

1) Order

2) Response to Stimuli

3) Reproduction

4) Adapation

5) Growth and Development

6) Regulation

7) Homeostasis

8) Processing

#### Hypothesese vs Prediction

*Prediction*: Often has 'If' at the beginning

*Hypothesis*: More of an explaination

Example: If my dog smells my shoe, he must like me. H or P? 

Prediction

Example: Dogs smell shoes to identify possible mates

Hypothesis

Example: If we water our plant every day, it will produce delicious apples

Prediction

#### Design an Experiment

Goal: Determine which type of light is best to grow bambo: 

* Natural Light
* Green Light
* Blue Light
* normal light bulb

*Indepdendent Variable*: Type of light

*Dependent Variable*: Growth of bamboo

Control: Sunlight

Replication: Multiple groups of bamboo under each type of light. 

#### Matter

Types of matter: 
* Gases
* Solid
* Liquid

Molecules:
* ionic bonds
* covalent bonds
* hydrogen bonds

Atoms:
* Subatomic particles
    * Neutron
    * Protron
    * Electron

#### Ionic Bonds

Atoms gain or lose one electron and are charged.

One atom is a donator and another is an acceptor

Weak bond

Seen in elements such as salt

#### Covalent Bonds
 
Atoms share electrons. 

Strong bond

Ex. Water between hydrogen and oxygen

When on atom loses its electron, it becomes positive charged. When theo ther gains an electron it becomes negatively charged and they are attracted to each other

#### Hydrogen Bond

Bond between hydrogen and another atom with a negative charge. 

Weak bond

#### Properties of water

* Cohesive

It sticks to itself. 

Has surface tension

Heart to break apart. 

* Water stabilizes temperatures

* High heat of evaporation 

It takes a lot of energy to break bonds in water

* Solid form is less dense than liquid form

* Ice Floats

* Water is a great solvant

* Polar Molecules

Partially positive and possibly negative

#### Acids and Bases

Acids = More Hydrogen Ions (H+)

Bases = Have more Hydroxides (HO)

Acids and Bases together cancel each other out and make water (Water is neutral)

Scale ranges from 0 -> 14 . Each step is 10x the number of hydrogen ions or hyrdooxide

0-6 = Acid

7 = Neutral

8-14 = Alkaline


#### Prokaryotic

Smaller and Older (1-10 Micrometers)

No Nucleus and ribosomes float freely

No organelles

Very simple

Additional structures: 
* Cell wall
* capsul
* Pili and Flagella


#### Eukaryotic

Much larger (10-100 micro meters)

Additional structures: 
* Nucleus with linear DNA
* Cytoskeleton
* Flagella and Cilia
* Organelle

#### Organelles in  Eukaryotic cells

* Nucleus: Genetic control center of the cell (DNA)

* Endoplastmic Reticulum

    * Rough ER: Coved in Ribosomes (Make proteins)
    * Smooth ER: No Ribosomes. Makes Lipids and detoxifies chemicals

* Golgi Apparatus:: Recieves packages from ER and distributes it to the cell

* Lysosomes: Contains acidic digestive enzymes

* Vesicles and Vacuoles: Storage and Transport

* Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell where glycosis occurs (Has DNA and ribosomes)


#### Plant vs Animal Cells

Plant Cells: 
* Cell Wall
* Chloroplast (Where photosynthesis occurs)
* Very large Vacules (Important for plant structure and holding water)


Animal Cells: 
* Centrioles (Where microtubuals exist)


#### Biomolecules

* Nucleic Acid

Creates DNA and RNA

Important for ou genetics

Important for energy tranfser. ATP = nucleic acid

Monomors: Nuclotides

* Carbohydrates

Provide energy and structure

Monomors: Monosacharides (Glucos)

* Lipids

Long term energy

Good for insulation, cushion. 

Monomors: Gliceral and Fatty Acids

* Proteins

Provides structure and energy.

Each of these are build up by smaller pieces called Monomers

Monomors: Amino Acids

#### Passive Transport

Doesnt require energy

High -> Low concentration

Ex: Diffiusion, Facilitated Diffusion (Needs a protrein to facilitate movement [Protein Channel]), Osmosis

#### Active Transport

Requires Energy (ATP)

Small molecules move against electrochemical gradient using proteins and energy

Ex: Endocytosis, active transport

#### Osmosis

Passive transport but requires a protein channel.

Hypotonic: Water can rush into a cell causing it to swell. 

Isotonic: Normal amount of water

Hypertonic: Water leaves cell and it shrivles 


#### Cellular Repsiration

1) Glycolisis

2) Galvin Cycle

3) Electroic Transport Chain

Electron Donor: NADH

Electron Acceptor: Oxygen

#### Photosythesis

1) Light Reactions

2) Galvin Cycle

Instead of breaking down glucos, you are taking genergy and turning it into glucose

Light Reactions: 
* Light from sun is used to make NADPH and ATP. 

* Water is the electron donor

Calvin Cycle: 

* NADPH and ATP are used to convert carbon dioxide to glucose

Electron Donor: Water

Electron Acceptor: NADP+

#### Glycolysis

Happens outside of the mitochondria

Breaks down of gylcose 

Glucose (6 carbon sugar) is broken down into pryruvate (3 carbon sugar) and ATP and NADH (electron carrier) are generated

#### Krebs Cycle

Pryruvate is broken down into acetyl CoA (2 Carbon sugar)

Acetyle CoA is broken down and carbon dioxide, ATP, NADH, and FADH are generated

#### Electron Transport Chain (ETC)

Electrons are transfered via a chain until accepted by Hydrogen

Main goal: Generate ATP

Electron is 'donated' by NADH
