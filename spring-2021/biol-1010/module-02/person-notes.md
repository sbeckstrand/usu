# Module 2

### Politicization of Science

##### Why is the public unwilling to accept scientific findings?

Contradict personal views

Lack of trust

Lack of comprehension

##### How can we increase the public's willingness to accept scientific findings? 

Improve communication between scientists and public

Scientists should improve their science communication skills

* Scientists should be able to explain research to the general public, not just experts in their field. 
* Scientists should use journalists to translate the implications of their research

### Letter to a congressperson assignment

* Must cite two reliable sources (and reference using APA)
* Once you find an issue you are passionate about
  * Research it
  * Research solutions to it
  * Write paragraphs
    * First: Why you support the current solution
    * Second Propose an alternative solution



**Am I alive? Examples:**

**Waves** - Repond to stimuli, do have energy, but do not have cells

**Algae** - Yes, Unicellular or multicellular

Yeast - Yes, Unicellular microorganisms. 

* Respiration (energy processing)

**Virus** - Depends on who you ask. (Generally considered not to be living)

* Why they might be 'not alive'
  * Not made up of cells
    * Made up of protein coat that surrounds their genetic material (DNA or RNA)
    * No cell membrane
  * Cannot reproduce independently
    * Use host cell to copy viral genetic material and make more viruses
  * No energy Processing
* Why thye might be 'alive'
  * Mimivirus contains the tools to copy its own DNA
  * Some bateria rely on energy from host and are considered alive



4 elements that make up 96% of us: 

* Oxygen (65.0%)
* Carbon (18.5%)
* Hydrogen (9.5%)
* Nitrogen (3.3%)

7 elements that make up the next majority: 

* Calcium 1.5%
* Phosphorus 1.0%
* Potassium
* Sulfer
* Sodium
* Cholorine
* Magnesium

(25 total) make up a human



### The Four Biomolecules

**Macromolecules** are large biologicval molecules that perform certain functions in our bodies. 

* Larger biological molecules made up by linking smaller molecules called **monomers**.

#### Carbohydrate

Monomer = Monosaccharide

Primary source of dietary energy

Energy storage in plants and animals (starch, glycogen)

Structural support for plants (Cellulose)

Three classes of Carbohydrates: 

* Monosaccharides (Single Sugar)
  * Glucose: Primary form of sugar used in the human body for energy
    * 6 carbons
  * Fructose: Main sugar in fruits
    * Also 6 carbons
* Disaccharides (Two Sugars)
  * Two monosaccharides linked together
  * Example: Sucrose: Table sugar
* Polysaccharides (Many sugars)
  * Two or more monosaccharides linked together
  * Examples: 
    * Starch: energy stored in plants
    * Glycogen: Energy storage in animals and fungi
    * Cellulose: Structural material in plants

Dietary giber: Carbohydrats that your body cannot digest (example: cellulose)

* Normalizes bowel movements
* lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels
* Aids in acheiving a healthy weight

### Lipid

Monomers = Glycerol + Fatty acids

##### Oils, Fats, and Waxes

Fats surround and cushion vital organs like kidneys

Fat insulates us from the cold

Fat is our fuel take - a strategic calorie reserve to protect against starvation (long-term energy storage)

The body relies on stored fules for energy after a few hours without eating

* Stored carbohydrates and protiens are dilute -- surrounded by lots of water
* Stored fat is highly concentrated and has more than twice the calories of carbohydrates and proteins



### Proteins

Most Abundant
