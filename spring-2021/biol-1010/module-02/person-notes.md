# Module 2

### Politicization of Science

##### Why is the public unwilling to accept scientific findings?

Contradict personal views

Lack of trust

Lack of comprehension

##### How can we increase the public's willingness to accept scientific findings? 

Improve communication between scientists and public

Scientists should improve their science communication skills

* Scientists should be able to explain research to the general public, not just experts in their field. 
* Scientists should use journalists to translate the implications of their research

### Letter to a congressperson assignment

* Must cite two reliable sources (and reference using APA)
* Once you find an issue you are passionate about
  * Research it
  * Research solutions to it
  * Write paragraphs
    * First: Why you support the current solution
    * Second Propose an alternative solution



**Am I alive? Examples:**

**Waves** - Repond to stimuli, do have energy, but do not have cells

**Algae** - Yes, Unicellular or multicellular

Yeast - Yes, Unicellular microorganisms. 

* Respiration (energy processing)

**Virus** - Depends on who you ask. (Generally considered not to be living)

* Why they might be 'not alive'
  * Not made up of cells
    * Made up of protein coat that surrounds their genetic material (DNA or RNA)
    * No cell membrane
  * Cannot reproduce independently
    * Use host cell to copy viral genetic material and make more viruses
  * No energy Processing
* Why thye might be 'alive'
  * Mimivirus contains the tools to copy its own DNA
  * Some bateria rely on energy from host and are considered alive



4 elements that make up 96% of us: 

* Oxygen (65.0%)
* Carbon (18.5%)

(25 total) make up a human



### The Four Biomolecules

**Macromolecules** are large biologicval molecules that perform certain functions in our bodies. 

* Larger biological molecules made up by linking smaller molecules called **monomers**.

#### Carbohydrate

Monomer = Monosaccharide

Primary source of dietary energy

Energy storage in plants and animals (starch, glycogen)

Structural support for plants (Cellulose)

Three classes of Carbohydrates: 

* Monosaccharides (Single Sugar)
  * Glucose: Primary form of sugar used in the human body for energy
    * 6 carbons
  * Fructose: Main sugar in fruits
    * Also 6 carbons
* Disaccharides (Two Sugars)
  * Two monosaccharides linked together
  * Example: Sucrose: Table sugar
* Polysaccharides (Many sugars)
  * Two or more monosaccharides linked together
  * Examples: 
    * Starch: energy stored in plants
    * Glycogen: Energy storage in animals and fungi
    * Cellulose: Structural material in plants

Dietary giber: Carbohydrats that your body cannot digest (example: cellulose)

* Normalizes bowel movements
* lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels
* Aids in acheiving a healthy weight

### Lipid

Monomers = Glycerol + Fatty acids

##### Oils, Fats, and Waxes

Fats surround and cushion vital organs like kidneys

Fat insulates us from the cold

Fat is our fuel take - a strategic calorie reserve to protect against starvation (long-term energy storage)

The body relies on stored fules for energy after a few hours without eating

* Stored carbohydrates and protiens are dilute -- surrounded by lots of water
* Stored fat is highly concentrated and has more than twice the calories of carbohydrates and proteins



### Proteins

Most Abundant 

----



### Nucleic Acids

Monomer = Nucleotide

**Deoxyribonucliec acid (DNA)** - Molecule of inheritance, stores information, provides directions for making proteins

**Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)** -  Protein synthesis

We do not need Necleotides in our diets.

Necleotides can be made. 

Example of a condition that involves nucleic acids: Gout. This occurs when there is an accumulation of broken down nucleotides (uric acid)



### Vitamins and Minerals

Vitamins: aAssis snzymes in regulating chemical pathways in cells

Minerals: Inorganic molecules imporant for many functions, bone and tooth development, sucsle function, nerve impulses, etc. 

### Water

Human body is 60-70% water and is needed for all cellular activies. 

1) Maintain normal blood pressure 

2) Maintain body temp

3) Eliminate solid waste from the body

4) To move nutrients and oxygen throught he bloodstream and to tissues and cells. 

Symtoms of dehydration: 

* Headaches
* dry mouth and lips
* Fatigue
* extreme thirst
* Muscle cramps
* confusion

## Cells

Smallest functional unit of an organism

Remember; All living organisms are made up of cells (one of the characteristics of life)

All cells have these four things in common: 

* Plasma membrane: Isolates cell contents from the environment
* Cytoplasm: Jelly like region inside the cell where cellular parts are found
* DNA: Genetic material of the cell
* Ribosomes: Particles that make proteins

Plasma Membrane: 

Passive Transport: Does not require energy

* Diffusion
  * 
  * Example: If you added a drop of food coloring to a cup of water, it would eventually be evenly spread out throughout the water. This happens with the food color molecules moving through the water. 
* Facilitated diffusion
  * Small molecules use proteins to move down a concentration gradient
  * Use carrier channels or __
  * Example: Glucose is too big to diffuse freely and needs membrane proteins.
* Osmosis (water)
  * Water diffuses across a selectively permeable membrane to equalize the concentration of dissolved particles inside and outside the cell.
  * In an isotonic solution, there is an equal number of dissolved particles as cell's cytoplasm
  * In an hypotonic solution, there is a lower concetration of dissolved particles than cell's cytoplasm
  * Hypertonic solution: Higher concentration of dissolved particles than cell's cytoplasm (Casing water to move out of cells and shrink)

Active transport; Does require energy

Small molecules move against an electrochemical gradient using proteins and energy

Endocytosis: Large molecules can enter via vesicles that bud inward. Triggered by certain external molecules binding to specific receptor proteins in membrane.

Two ptypes of Cells: 

#### Prokaryotic Cells

Remember, all cells have four parts. 

Cell Wall: Gives cell shape and structure and offers protection

Capsule: Outer coating, slime layer (Polysaccharides, proteins) that can be secreted outside the cell wall for protection

Pili: Hair-like projections used to attach to surfaces or exchange genetic material



#### Eukaryotic Cells

Has the four primary Cell components

DNA: Within a Eukaryotic cells the DNA is in the nucleus

Ribosomes: 

* Mostly embedded on edoplasmic reticulum
* Some in the cytoplasm

Cytoskeleton: Network of protein fibers that give shape and organization to the cytoplasm

Flagella & Cilia: Flagella are LONG stuctures that help move the cell through fluid. Cilia are SHORT structures to move fluid past the cell structure. 

Organelles: Membrane enclosed structures that perform specific functions (nucleus, endoplasmic retriculum, golgi, apparatus, mitochondria, lysosome, vesicles or vacuoles)



Eukaryotic vs Prokaryotic

| -                              | -                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1-10 um (size)                 | 10-100 um (size) |
| Cell wall                      | Have a nucleus   |
| Capsule                        | Organelles       |
| Pili                           |                  |
| DNA located in nucleoid region |                  |
| Domains: Bacteria and Archaea  |                  |
| Flagella                       |                  |
|                                |                  |

## Organelles

### Nucleus

Largest Organelle

### Endoplasmic Reticulus

Rough ER: covered in ribosomes. Ribosomes are protein making machines

* 

Smooth ER: no ribosomes on the surface

* lipids 
* detoxifies chemicals



### Golgi Apparatus

Processes and packages proeins, lipids, and other molecules for export to other locations inside and outside of the cell

Think kof it as a distribution warehouse

Receives proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum and sorts, tags and packages and distirbutes them



### Lysosomes

"garbage dispoals" of cells

Digest proteins, sugars, lipids, nucleic acids

Digestive enzymes ahve a low pH

Very important in immunity



### Vesicles and Vacuoles

Storage containers and transporters of molecules in cells

Allow molecules to get through cytoplasm and plasma membrane



### Mitochondria

Most of cellular respiration occurs here

Oxygen and Glucose are converted into ATP (the energy currency of the cell)

Cells with high conentrations of mito



## Plant Cells

### Cell Walls

Only in plants, fungi, and some protists

Rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support and gives shape to the cell

Cell membrane is just inside the cell wall

### Centrioles

Organelles that synthesize microtubules of cilia and flagella

Produce asters and spindles for cell division

### Chloroplasts

Photosynthesis occurs here. Energy from su nlight is converted into chemical energy (glucose)

Chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes. 

Remember, Mitochondria also has its own DNA and ribosomes.
