### Telomers

Repeating sequences of TTAGGG on the end of DNA strands (like plastic ends on shoe laces)

Telomers get shorter each time a cell divides

RNA primers which were added for DNA polymerase to synthesize DNA are removed at the end of DNA replication, leaving single-stranded overhang of DNA

Average cell loses 30 to 200 base pairs from the end of its telomers each time it divdes. 

Cells normally divide 50 to 70 times with telomers becoming progressively shorter until the cell dies. 

Without telomeres, the main part of our chromosomes with DNA for genes essential for life owuld get shorter each time a cell divides. 

### Telomerase

Telomerase binds to an RNA molecule with a complementary sequence to the telomeric repeat

RNA used as a template to add nucleotides to the overhanging strand. 

Primase and DNA polymerase synthesize omplementary DNA

Telomerase remains active in sperm and egg cells. This is important so organisms do not go extinct. 

Unfortunately, telomerase is not usually active in most adult non-productive cells. 

### Proofreading

DNA polymerase usually corrects errors during replication and incorrect bases are removed and rpelaced with correct ones. 


### Mismatch repair

Error detected *after* replication and mismatch repair enzymes detect and remove incorrect base. 

### DNA Replication errors

When errors are not repaired or are repaired incorrectly, they are referred to as mutations

Mutation: Permanent change in DNA sequences. 

### Mutagen

Mutagen: An agent that changes DNA of an organism

* Chemicals (e.g. carcinogens)
* Radiation (e.g. UV, x-rays, nuclear radiation)
* Viruses

On average, there is one DNA mutation per lung cell for every 50 cigarettes smoked. 

People who smoke a pack of 20 cigarettes a day for a year generate: 

* 150 mutations per lung cell
* 97 mutations per larynx cell

Mutations are not passed on unless it alters the egg or sperm cells. 

## Forensic DNA Analysis

Uses for DNA fingerprinting: 
* Primarily rape cases
* Paternity testing
* Historical/missing persons cases. 

### Amelogenin Gene

* Target sequence to be copied
* Gene function -- tooth enamel development
* Copies on both X and Y chromosome - X copy is shorter than Y copy. 

In order to doncut forensic tests, you need many copies of the amelogenin gene target sequence, which you will make using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) PCR follows the steps of replication. Which of the following would allow replication to begin? 

A: Add short stretches of single stranded DNA complementary to the sequence at either end of the gene

B: Add DNA Polymerase Enzyme

C: Break the covalent bonds that hold the double helix together

D: Break the hydrogen bonds 


## Mitosis

Mitosis: Cell division process that creates two daughter cells that are genetically identical to each other and the parent cell. 

Used for: 

* growth (Increase the number of cells)

* Repair and replacement: 

Mitosis is part of the cell cycle. 

**Cell Cycle** A sequence of growth and division event in non-reporductive cells (body cells). 

1: Interphase: Cell growse and makes copies of its DNA. 

Three parts of interphase: 

#### G_1 phase

Cell grows physically larger

Organellese and cytoplasm are duplicated

#### S phase

DNA is replicated

### Five stages of Mitosis

Prophase

Prometaphase

Metaphase

Anaphase

Telophase

#### Prophase

* CHromosomes start to condense and become visible

* Spindle fibers emerge from the centrosomes

* Nuclear envelope breaks down

* Centrosomes move toward opposite poles

#### Prometaphaes

* Chromeosomes continue to condense

* Kinetochores appear at the centromers

* Mitotic spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores.
