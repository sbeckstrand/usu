#### What is Biology? 

Science that studies life.

**Inductive Reasoning** - Used related observations to arrive at a general conclusion

**Deductive Reasoning** - Uses a general principle, theory, or law to forecast specific results

#### General Notes about 'Science'

Outcome = Conclusion

Features:

* Replicable or confirmed observation
* Debate and test
  * Evidence
  * Linkage of observation and explanation
* Verification through replication
* Tentative and revisable system

#### Properties of Life

Living things are composed of one or more cells (Cellular organization)

Organisms use and transform energy in a process callsed **metabolism**

Organisms maintain stable internal conditions (Homeostasis/regulation)

Life reproduces itself

Organisms possess a genetic system and transmit characteristics from parent to offspring (Heredity allows for adaption)

Organisms grow and develop according to genetic code

Organisms respond to stimuli



#### Seven Kingoms of Organisms

* Eukarya
  * Fungi
  * Animalia
  * Chromista
  * Plantae
  * Protista
* Archaea
* Bacteria



Biologists study life at many levels of organization. Ranging from a molecular level to an ecosystem level. 

#### Biologial themes that will be regularly visisted

* Biological structures and how they are closely related to their functions
* Maintaining homeostasis has contributed to complexity
* Evolution is the change in populations over time
* Energy flow through food chains shapes ecosystems
