#### General Notes

While talking about biology we will also discuss social issues related to biology.

#### What is Biology? 

Science that studies life.

**Inductive Reasoning** - Used related observations to arrive at a general conclusion

**Deductive Reasoning** - Uses a general principle, theory, or law to forecast specific results

#### General Notes about 'Science'

Outcome = Conclusion

Features:

* Replicable or confirmed observation
* Debate and test
  * Evidence
  * Linkage of observation and explanation
* Verification through replication
* Tentative and revisable system

#### Properties of Life

Living things are composed of one or more cells (Cellular organization)

Organisms use and transform energy in a process callsed **metabolism**

Organisms maintain stable internal conditions (Homeostasis/regulation)

Life reproduces itself

Organisms possess a genetic system and transmit characteristics from parent to offspring (Heredity allows for adaption)

Organisms grow and develop according to genetic code

Organisms respond to stimuli



#### Seven Kingoms of Organisms

* Eukarya
  * Fungi
  * Animalia
  * Chromista
  * Plantae
  * Protista
* Archaea
* Bacteria



Biologists study life at many levels of organization. Ranging from a molecular level to an ecosystem level. 

#### Biologial themes that will be regularly visisted

* Biological structures and how they are closely related to their functions
* Maintaining homeostasis has contributed to complexity
* Evolution is the change in populations over time
* Energy flow through food chains shapes ecosystems



#### Hypothesis Tests



##### Difference between Theory and Hypothesis

**Hypothesis** = a bes t(or educated guess that is testable and based on observation and or prior knowledge)

**Theory**

**Law**



#### Science does not have all the answers. 

Science is limited to things that can be served by more than one person. 

Biases affect tests

Science cannot make a solution where one does not exist

Sometimes there is bad data

Sometimes scientists make mistakes and misinterperet data



### The Chemistry of Life

**Matter** - Something that occupies space and has mass

**Atom** Smallest unit of matter

Atoms have three components

* Neutron - Neutral, no charge
* Proton = Positive Charge
* Electron = Negative charge

States of matter: 

* Solid 
  * Fixed volume and shape
* Liquid
  * Fixed volume and variable shape
* Gas
  * Variable volume and shape

**Element** - A substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means

**Molecule** - Two or more atoms combined with a chemical bond

**Ionic**

Atoms that have gained or lost an electron and are charged 

One element donates an electron and becomes positively charged, or the other 

Attraction between oppositely charged ions

**Covalent bond** 

Electrons are shared 

Strong bond

**Hydrogen bond**

Weak bond between a hyrodgen atom with a partial positive charge and an atom with a partial negative charge



### Unique Properties of Water

Note, water is a hydrogen bond

Water is cohesive (It sticks together). This gives water a high surface tension (the tendency of liquid to resist repture when placed under tension. 

Cohesion and adhesions is allows water to move up through roots of plants. 

Water stabilzes temperature

Water absorbs and releases heat more slowly than other substances. 

More heat is required to break hydrogen bonds

Water helps moderate temperature on land. Areas with large amounts of water have more regulated temperatures. 

Solid form of water is less dense than liquid form

Whater is an excellent solvent - Water dissolves a wide range of ions and polar modules but does not dissolve nonpolar molecules. This is important because it means it wont disolve things like blood cells

Primary 4 properties

* Water is cohesive
* Water stabilizes temperatures
* Solid form of water is less dense than liquid form
* Water is an excellent solvent (dissolves substances)

### Acid, Bases and pH

Water molecules constantly gain, lose and swap hydrogen atoms

H+ = Hyrogen ion

OH- = Hydroxide Ion

Base = More Hydroxide Ion than Hydrogen Ions

Acid = More Hyrdogen Ions than Hydroxide Ion

Each pH level has 10 times as many hydrogen ions than the previous 

7 is the neutral pH level. 

ph = -log[H+]

Stomach is acidic to beak down consumped material

Blood is alkaline
