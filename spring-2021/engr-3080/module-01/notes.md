## Module 1: The Importance of Technical Communication



#### General Notes

This is not a standard English class. You will not write persuasive pieces. It focuses on professional/business related documents and writing. 

You will participate in a presentation at the end of the semseter. 

Like with playing music or sports it is necessary to practice your writing to improve. With that in mind, it is likely you will receive a poor grade for an assignment finished last minute and/or not well thought out. 

Throw out the notion that 'I am a bad writer', it takes practice. 

Grammar is an important component to this class. 

#### What it means to be a professional

You are already in a professional program. 

To be a professional means you have a specific skillset.
