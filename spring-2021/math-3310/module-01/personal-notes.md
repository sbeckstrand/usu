#### 0.1 Helping Undergraduates Learn to Read Mathematics

We are taught to read at a young age and there is an expection to improve reading ability throughout all phases of school. Typically our reading ability is associated with literature and history but rarely is it expected that our ability to read mathematics will improve. 

Typically we rely most on lectures and discussions for learning and consider mathematic reading as supplimentary ("Fill in the gaps"). Because of this, there is a lack of proficiency in reading mathematics in undegraduate students. 

Note that it takes a great deal of practice to improve your abilility to read mathematics. 

###### Reading Theorems

Questions to consider while reading theorems: 

* What kind of theorem is this? (Examples below)
  * Classification of a type of object.
  * Equivalence of definitions
  * Implication between definitions
  * Proof of when a technique is justified
* What's the content of the theorem?
* Why are each of the hypotheses needed? 
  * When considering each hypotheses, consider what counter examples would be available if the hypotheses was not present. 
* How does this theorem relate to other theorems?
  * Does it strengthen another theorem we are arleady aware of or one that has already been proven? 
* What's the motivation for this theorem and what question does it answer?

When reading a proof, consider reading each step as a block on top of the previous step instead of being independent. Make sure each step is legal when considering the previous steps. 

After reading a theorem, you can ask yourself the following questions to help ensure you understand it: 

* Can I write a brief outline of the logic of the argument, explain why the proof is a proof?
* What mathematical raw materials are used in the proof? 
* What does the proof tell you about why the theorem holds? Consier the limitations and considtions necessary for the proof to hold. 
* Where is each hypotheses used in the proof?



###### Reading Definitions

Questions to consider while reading definitions:

* What does this definition apply to? (Ex: integers, matrices, sets, functions, some part of items, etc)

* How do we check that the definition is satisfied? 

* Does anything satisfy this definition? Is there a whole class of things wh ich I am already aware of that satisfy this definition? 

* What doesnt satisfy this definition?

* What properties do these objects have, that would motivate us to make this definition? 

* Is there a classification we are aware of for the things being defined? 

  



##### Thoughts for reflection

We had to write papers for math 1050 (College Algebra) and describing math concepts and definitions helped to get the material down. 

Relying on lecture materials and problems results in a reliance on others to learn and may limit your learning ability. 



#### 1.1 General Background of Set Theory & Mathematical Logic

**Syllogism** - basis of logic. It has a major and minor premise and a conclusion. 

Exercise: Come up with your own syllogism: 

* Major Premise: Glasses contain two lenses
* Minor Premise: Lenses are convex pieces of clear material designed to improve visibility
* Conclusion: Glasses are used to improve visibility of the wearer.

**Statement** - A meaningful declarative sentence that is true or false. 

A statement declares something.



###### Problem 1.1.1: 

Consider the following two statements and ask yourself if they are *logically* saying the same thing. 

"Good food isn't cheap. Cheap food isn't good".

Assuming that the same definition of 'good' and 'cheap' are being applied in both statements, both statements imply the same thing, though the context of the statements will differ in that one is considering good food, while the other is considering cheap food.  Certainly there is some subjection to the terms 'good' and 'cheap'. For example, one may consider something to be 'good' based on its taste, its nutritional value, the environmental impact to acquire the food, etc. Similarly with 'cheap', if just considering a cost of currency, cheap will vary depending on who you ask. However, as stated, as long as the definition of 'good' and 'cheap' is the same in both statements, they will mean the same thing.
