### Online Music Encounters

Four short projects/essays based on experience and connection with music. 

Each paper requires at least 800 words. (Include the word count at the end of assignment)



##### Encounter 1: Desert Island Playlist

```
You wake to find yourself stranded on a deserted island. However, the supernatural force that caused this to happen allows you to have all of the music of one recording artist or band sent to you, as well as a way to listen to it all. Discuss who this artist/band would be, and which songs (no more than three) would be the first you listen to.
```



##### Encounter 2: Tindy Desk Concert

```
Summarize a concert that you watch either online or in person this semester. I highly recommend NPR’s Tiny Desk Concerts (Links to an external site.)—these are a series of over 800 short online performances and interviews you can choose from featuring a variety of artists and styles.  Describe the social interactions and musical elements you observe in as much detail as you can.  If you prefer, you can write about another concert livestream you find, or a live concert you’re able to attend this semester (preferably rock or pop, but any live musical performance will count).
```



##### Encounter 3: Pop Music Podcast

```
Summarize an episode you find on a popular music-related podcasts
```



##### Encounter 4: Song Exploder Screencast

```
Song Exploder is a new Netflix series based on a popular podcast that takes one song and analyzes it both historically, as well as musically.  We’re going to use this model to create our own exploded-song video.  Choose any song that interests you from a popular style (rock, pop, country, R&B, etc.), and create a video screencast of at least 5 minutes that describes the song in as much detail as you can.  No accompanying report is needed; just a URL to your YouTube link.
```

Responses should contain at least 300 words (Include word count).
