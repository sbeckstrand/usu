# CS 1440 Assignment 2 Hints

## Print debugging messages to standard error

If you want to add extra calls to `print()` for your own debugging purposes,
but not have it affect my grading, be sure to send the output to the standard
error file.  You can see how to do this in `src/main.py`.


## area_titles.csv

*   Read this file line-by-line. As you read it in:
    *   Discard unwanted FIPS areas as you read.
    *   Collect this data into a Python dictionary mapping FIPS codes to area
        titles.
*   FIPS area codes follow a simple pattern which makes it easy to exclude the
    national aggregate, statewide aggregate metropolitan and micropolitan
    areas.
*   `area_titles.csv` contains 4,724 lines of text, of which the first is a CSV
    header line.  After discarding unwanted FIPS areas you will be left with
    3,461 FIPS areas.
*   Read the `help()` documentation for `str.split` to learn how to split each
    line of `area_titles.csv` into exactly two fields regardless of the number
    of commas encountered.


## 2018.annual.singlefile.csv

*   Read this file line-by-line. As you read it in:
    *   Discard lines from FIPS areas which do not belong in the report.
    *   Discard lines from industries which do not belong in the report.
*   Keep track of the data required for the report. You must accumulate totals
    as well as store maximum values for three categories.
*   This is a very big file and your program will take a long time to read it
    (my implimentation takes ~6.5 seconds to read it once on my laptop).
    Strive to minimize the number of times your program reads through it.
*   Make sure that you have a program that *works* before you worry about
    having a program that is *fast*.
