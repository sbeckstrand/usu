### Assignment:

Make sure to remove casing and punctuations

Should not be searching through array. Use array to build binary search tree

Binary search tree should not read directly
  - Read dictionary from driver code



### Stacks

(First on Last Off) (FILO)
  - Static (fixed upper-bound) size Stacks
  - Dynamic size Stacks
      - Can grow to as much memory is on system.


  Two Oprations involved with stacks:
    - push (add to stack)
    - pop (remove from stack)


### Queues

(First on First Off) (FIFO)
A Queue is a line. It can be static in size, or dynamic.

We add to the back of the queue and remove from the front of the queue

Abstract classes
Generics

  - equal and toString methods
  - only works with reference types (class type), do not work with primatives (int)
Recursion
  - What it means
  - Two minimum requirements to be recursive
    - at least one base case
    - At least one recursion step
  - More overhead involved with recursion
  - Understand how to read Recursion
Comparable Interface
  - compareto method
Linked List
  - Node has value and reference to next node
Bianary Search tree
Java collections / connection interface
