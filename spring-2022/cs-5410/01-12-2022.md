## Introduction

### Background

- Competent in a language like C++, Java, or C#
- Have taken CS 2420, CS3100 or equivalent
- Useful to have taken any of CS 5200, CS 5400, CS 5600, CS 5700

### What is this Course? 

#### Mathias' Purpose: 

Emphasize and integrate multiple Compute rScience topics using game development as the platform

    - We are writing games and learning about game development, but surprisingly, that is a secondary purpose of this class
    - To that end, it isn't a course on using a game engine to create games. 

- Platform choices: Concepts apply across implementation platforms
    - HTML & JavaScript: lead platform
        - Many of you will write a lot of JavaScript proessionally
    - C# and MonoGame: Supported platform
        - C# is widely used in the industry
        - MonoGame provides for development to mobile phones and consoles

- Large project and team collaboration

### What is this course NOT?

- How to use Unreal, Unity, GameMaker, etc

- Computer Graphics course

- Game Design

- Educational Games

- Gamification of ___

### Other Thoughts

- Expectation that students will have to find and learn material not necessarily presented in class

- Dont assume strong background with Javascript: provide some insturction during the first three weeks
    - Will also provide some C# info

- Weekly quizzes during the first part of semester; outside of class, using Canvas
    - Often including questions for game dev videos I'll have you watch

- Once the final project starts, will take the latter part of weekly classes to review project/team status

### Is Game Development CS?

TL;DR yes

Introduces concepts from several courses

- Software Engineering
- Languages/Scripting
- Algorithms
- etc

### Required Text

None

### Lecture Topics: 

- Game Engine Architecture

### Course Grading

- Quizzes 5%
- Projects 75%
- Mid Term 20%

### Mid-term 

Game Project that is set to go. You are required to write a mini game

### Email Communication

Remember that there is another person on the other end. 

Always, alwaysl always use respectful communication.

Careful about the terms "Confused", "Don't Understand"

## Games Components and Architecture

### What is a game? 

Game Theory: 

- Multiple agents select strategies and tactics to maximize their gains within a framework of a well-defined set of game rules. 

- This class is not about Game Theory

Ralph Koster (A Theory of Fun for Game Design)

- Lead designer for Ultima Online 

- He says a game is an interactive experience that providest he player with an increasingly challenging sequence of patterns which he or she learns and eventually masters

- He argues that learning and mastering are at the heart of what we call "fun"

### Game Development

Games are software, therefore game development is software development

A key difference in game development vs general software development might be the wide scope of topics involved, not necessarily the complexity or performance considerations. 

### Who is involved?

Engineers 
- Technical Directors
- Engine Developers
- Gameplay/Scripting
- Tools

Game Designers (Obviously the most important!)

Produces

Publishers and Studios

Content Providers
- Concept Artists
- Texture Artists
- Lighting Artists
- 3D modelers
- Animators
- Motion Capture Actors
- Sound Designers/Composers

### What is a Game Engine?

What is used in common with every game you write. 

### Game Engine

Concept probably started in mid-1990's with Doom
- Designed to separate core software components and assets
- Started with community developing "mods" for the game (also DeHackEd)
- Evolved into the full concept of a "game engine" as it was licensed
- Further evolution with Quake. Designed from the ground up to be extendable, using a scripting language called "QuakeC"

Now we have fully supported commercialized Game Engines
- Unreal
- Unity
- Many others...

A data-driven architecture is key to developing a true game engine
- Want to eliminate hard-coded: logic, rules of play, characters, weapons, and other assets

Levels: 
- Cannot be used to build more than one game
- Can make similar types of games
- Can be modded to build any game in a specific genre
- Can be used to build any game imaginable (Probably impossible)

### Game Engine Categories

- First/Third Person Shooters
- Adventure, RPG
- Action RPG
- Platformers
- Fighting Games
- Simulation, Racing Games
- Real-Time Strategies
