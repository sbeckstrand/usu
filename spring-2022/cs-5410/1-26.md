## HTML5 Canvas Rendering

Canvas is an element in HTML5 that supports 2D or 3D rendering

An HTML element is a container for graphics rendering

2D - native Canvas API
3D - OpenGL ES

Features
- Lines
- Shapes
- Paths (including curves)
- Text/Fonts
- Images & Pizel Manipulation
- Transformations (rotation, scaling). 

```HTML
<canvas id='id-canvas' width='500', height='500'></canvas>
```

HTML width/height ist he rendering coordinate system
CSS width/height is the visible size of the canvas element

```HTML
<canvas id="id-canvas" width="500, height="500" style ="width: 750px"; height="750px">
```
size in browser = 750 x 750 pixels
 
 coordinate system is 500 x 500

 ```HTML
<canvas id="id-canvas" width="500, height="500" style ="width: 75%"; height="75%">
```

Size in brownser is 75% of width and 75% of height

Coordinate system is still 500 x 500

### Coordinate System

Upper Left: (0,0)

Lower Right: (Width -1, height -1)

Increasing Y moves down

Increasing X moves right

Notes: 
- This is not typically what you are used to in a Cartesian coordinate system where lower left is (0,0)
- In context of browser, however, it makes sense to put (0,0) in the upper left. 


### JavaScript - HTML Connection

Obtaining the canvas Object

```
let canvas = document.getELementByID('id-canvas');
let context = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

Canvas is a reference the HTML element

Context is a reference to the canvas API; this is what you want/need: 
- CanvasRenderingContext2D

### CLearing the canvas

Once you draw something, it persists until cleared

Clearing the whole canvas

```
context.clearRect(0,0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```
