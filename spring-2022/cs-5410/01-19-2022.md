## Resource Management

System Responsible for manipulation of content/assets
- Textures
- Models
- Animations
- Geometry
- SOunds
- Strings

Usage Optimization

Asset Streaming (prediction)

## Rendering

This is what draws thigns to the screen

Interface/abstraction to low-level API
    - Game systems use this interface, d not directly use low-level API
    - What is a low-level API: OpenGL, Direct X, Vulkan, Metal

Configuration
    - Screen resolutions
    - Aspect Ratio
    - Color Depth (How many colors can be displayed)
        - HDR is the new cool kid
            - 10 bits per color channel instead of the default 8, which can already display an insane amount of color


Font Rendering
- Difficult task to do
- Low-level APIs have 0 font-rendering

Rendering API is used to abtract away from using API. 

### Features

Scene Graph
- Game environment/simulation
- Literally a graph
- Top down tree structure

2D Rendering

3D Rendering

Camera Model
- Positioning
- Depth in field

Animation

Particles

Video

Visual Effects

Post Processing
- Film Grain
- Motion Blur
- 4K checkerboard reconstruction

Offline rendering
- Shadow, lightmaps

AR/VR

HUD (Head's Up Display)

## Audio

This is what makes your speaker(s) do something

Interface/abstraction to low-level API

Game systems use this interface, do not directly use low-level API

Features:
- Output to standards (e.g., all things Dolby)
- Point source spatialization
- Propagation
- Mixing
- Multi-channel (4.0, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1)

Uses
- In-Game effects
- Music, dynamic
- Menu clicks
- Screen transitions

## Input

Sources: 
- Keyboard
- Mouse(+motion smoothing)
- Game controllers
- Sound (voice recognition)
- Video (Eye Toy, Kinect - RIP)

Technical Approaches
- Publisher - Subscriber model
- Input queue and pull from queue
- Multiple queues, one for each input type

## Networking

Users
- Sharing of game data
    - Characters, stats, saved games, etc.
- Social communities
    - Chat, mail, clans, guilds
- Multiplayer
    - Client/Server
    - P2P
    - MMO (still client/server)

Issues/Technical
- TCP/IP using TCP or UDP
- Bandwidth: how much data 
    - Limits # of players
- Latency: round trip time
    - Limits speed of interactions
- Packet loss
    - Affects game t ypes and experience of players
- Synchronization
    - Maintaining a consistent world state across all players

## Physics

Used to describe the movement of objects in the game environment

Term/Users
- Ridgid Body Physics: Think of the ubiquitos crate
- Rag doll Physics: Describe non-animated movement of moels
- Vehicle Simulations
- Cloth Simulation
- Explosion Simulation: Instead of artists manually animating
- Collision Detection: Detect wh en objets interact. Used to be part of the graphics part of the engine, but not really anymore

Doesn't have to be realistic, instead it needs to be fun

JavaScript Physics Library: Matter-JS

MonoGame: Box2D

## Scripting

Loosen coupling betweent he gameplay and the core game services
    - Game Services ("engine") usually written in C/C++
    - Gameplay likely written in something else; but not necessarily

Think of it as the "glue" between the game and the game engine

Examples of game scripting Languages
- JavaScript
- C#
- Python
- Lua
- Custom (e.g., GOAL, UnrealScript)
- C++

## Artificial Intelligence

General collection of techniques used to produce the illusion of intelligent behavior in non-player controlled game characters

Possible Inclusion (in an engine)
- Actions - The gameplay/engine coding interface
- Information gathering - What can be sensed by the components
- Goals, planning, decision making
- Navigation, path finding
- Finite State Machines

Lots of approaches to AI, whatever works

## Frameworks

MonoGame (OpenSource XNA Framework)
- PC, Mobile, Console
- Bindings: C#

Simple Direct Media Layer (libSDL)
- PC, Mobile
- Bindings: C, C#, Lua, Python, Rust, others..

Simple Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)
- PC, Mobile (experimental, but in good shape; so they say)
- Bindings: C, C#, Java, Python, Rust, others..

Unreal Engine
- PC, Web, Mobile, Console, Vr
- Bindings: C++
- Other: Blueprints - Visual Scripting

Unity

CryEngine
- PC, Console, VR
- Bindings: C++
- Other: Flowgraph - Visual Scripting

Open 3D Engine
- Successor to Amazon Lumberyard, itself based on CryEngine, but I believe an "all new" engine
- Windows, Linux, macOS (coming), Android (coming), iOS (coming)
- Bindings: Script Canvas, Lua

## The Game Loop

DONT REINVENT THIS

1) Initialize Game
    - Load Graphics, models, animations, etc
    - Take initial time-stamp; call it previous time-stamp
2) Process Input
3) Update Game Logic
- Take current time-stamp; compute elapsed time
- Update based on elapsed time
4) Render Game State
5) Move current time-stamp to previous time-stamp
6) (if fixed rate) use spin-lock to wait until frame-time expires
7) If done, move to step 8, otherwise return to step 2
8) Termination

## Initialization 

```C# 
function processInput(elapsedTime) {
    keyboard.update(elapsedTime);
}
```

```C#
function update(elapsedTime) {
    gameModelupdate(elapsedTime);
}
```

```C#
function render() {
    gameModel.render();
}
```

```C#

function gameLoop(timeStamp) {
    elapsedTime = timeStamp - prevTime;
    processInput(elapsedTime);
    update(elapsedTime);
    render();

    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

## Timing

Frame Rate: Measure din HR; Frames per second (fps)

Frame Time: AMount of time within a frame (delta)t
- The entire game simulation and rendering must take place in this amount of time
- If 30 fps, each frame has 33.ms for everything!

## Which Time?

Wall-Clock Time: Real -world elapsed time

Simulation Time: How much game-play time has passed

Thewe two might be the same, but dont have to be
- Consider Bullet-Time
    - Game frame-rate stays the same
    - Game simulation slow does
    - Player continues to react in real-time (MOL)


## Moving Objects

Bad Idea; Move some number of virtual meters per frame

Not as bad idea; Mov esome number of virtual meters based on running frame-rate average
    - x_2 = x_1 + v (delta) t_ave

Best Idea: 
    - x_2 = x_1 + v(delta)t_frame)

Fixed Frame Rate
    - x_2 = x_1 + v 1/fps


## C# Game Loop

Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game

- protected void Initialize(): One time at startup

- protected void LoadContent() : one time at startup

- protected void Unload Content(): One time at termination

- protected void Update(GameTime): Repeatedly

- protacted void Draw(GameTime) : repeatedly

You write a class that derives from Game, and then overrides these methods

Note there is no ProcessInput, that is performed during the Update method
    - But *I* want you to write a Process Input method and call it *first* thing in Update

An Instance of your class is crated and Run method is called
    - Inside this method, a bunch of th igns happen, including calling the above methods. 

```C#
protected override void Initialize()
{
    m_gameModel.initialize();
    // Set window properties here
}
```

```C#
protected override void LoadContent()
{
    m_gameModel.loadContent();
}
```

```C#
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
    m_gameModel.processInput(gameTime);
    m_gameModel.update(gameTime);
}
```

```C#
protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
    m_gameModel.draw(m_graphics, gameTime);
}
```

```C#
public class MyGame : Game
{
    ...
}
```
