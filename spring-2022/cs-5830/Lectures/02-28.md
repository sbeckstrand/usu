# Naive-based classifiers

Predicting gender by name

With a dataset of male and female names, we are going to take a name and predict gender. 

```python
def gender_features(name):
    return { 'last_letter': word[-1]}

gender_features('Stanley')
```

Examples:

```python

names.words('male.txt')
names.words('female.txt')

male = [(name, 'male') for name in names.words('male.txt')]
female = [(name, 'female') for name in names.words('female.txt')]

labeled_names = male + female

random.shuffle(labled_names)
```

```python
featuresets = [(gender_features(name), gender) for (name, gender) in labeled_names]

train_set, test_set = train_test_split(featuresets)

classifier = nktk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set) # Computes the percentage of names ending in letters by gender
```

```python
print(classifier.classify(gender_features('Neo'))) # Male
print(classifier.classify(gender_features('Trinity'))) # Female
print(classifier.classify(gender_features('Amy'))) # Female
print(classifier.classify(gender_features('Andy'))) # Female
print(classifier.classify(gender_features('Laren'))) # Male


```
