## Memory

```c++
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
    int a = 0;
    int b = 0;
    int* pA = NULL;
    int c;


    return 0;
}
```
In memory: 

a   | 0 | 0x1000
b   | 0 | 0x1001
pA  | 0 | 0x1002
c   | ? | 0x1003

int = 4 bytes of memory


Variable names are references to addresses (0x1004, etc)
