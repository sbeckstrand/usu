### Binary Decimal places: 

In decimal: 

100s, 10s, 1s, . 10th, 100ths, 1000ths,

In Binary

8, 4, 2, 1 . 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16


It is impossible to represent 1/3 in binary. We have to approximate. 

### Equation to approximate floating point numbers: 

0.101 -> S x (1 + m) x 2^(E + bias) 

S = Sign bit
m = mantissa = Everything after the decimal
E = Exponent
bias = 127

### Signs

-1 = 1111 1111

1000 : 0000 = -128
1000 : 0001 = -127
1000 : 0010 = -126

This is done through Two's complement value

unsigned = no negitive
signed = complement value

### Convert from Decimal to 2s compliment

Say we want to find -6. 

1) First find 6: 

0000 0110

2) Traverse from the right until you get to the first 1. 

01

3) Bit flip everything after the first 1

1111 1010 = -6

-125 = 0111 1101 -> 1000 0011


### Homework

tmin solution: 1<<31 (Shift the 1 over 31 times)
