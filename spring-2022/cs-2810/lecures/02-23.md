## Memory Continued

```
string bob;
int a = 98;
int b = -98;
float pi = 3.14159;

int* pA = nullptr;

int c[100];

pA[1] = 100
```

Syntax <int>(point) = place in memory. 

$1 = 100

$2 = 200

$3

## Referencing and Dereferencing

Referencing an object - Taking its address and assigning it to a pointer variable (e.g., &i)

Dereferencing a pointer means - Going to the memory address pointed to by the pointer, and accessing the value there (e.g., *p)

Example:

int i; // i is an int variable
int *p; // p is a pointer to int
p = &i; // referencing i
    // p is assigned 1056
*p = 5; //dereference p
    // i assigned 5

```
int i;      // variable
int a[10];  // array of integers
int *p;     // pointer to integer

p = &i;     // & = address of i
p = a;      // a means &a[0]
p = &a[5]   // Address of 6th element of a
*p;         // Value at location pointed by p
*p = 1;     // Change value at that location
*(p+1) = 1  // Change value at next location
p[1] = 1;   // Exactly the same as above
p++;        // Step pointed to the next element
```

## Revissting Operands

Operands = the variables needed to perform an instructions operation

Types in the MIPS ISA: 

Register: `add $2, $3, $4

## MIPS Conditionals (Guess a MIPS)

Random number = `random int range` = syscall 42

User input = `read integer` = syscall = 5

## x86 TickTock assignment
