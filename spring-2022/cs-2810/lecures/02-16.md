# x86 Assembly Assignment Review

`strings` - Utility to print text strings in a file. This is going to be used in all of the next assignements. 

Next assignment will require the correct input to trigger correct sequences. 

## Working with Constants

addi = add immediate

`addi $5, $5, 2000` - This adds 2000 to the constant in register 5

`addi $5, $5, -60` - This subtracts 60 from the constant in register 5

`addi $10, $0, 1234` - This adds the value 1234 at register 10. 

sll = shift left 

`sll $5, $5, 16` - Shift value in reg 5 by 16 bits and store it in $5. 

ori = or immediate

lui = load upper immediate. Does addi + sll combo. 

## Accessing Memory

MIPS is a "load-store" architecture

- All operands for ALU instructions are in registers or immediate
- Cannot directly add values residing in memory
  - Must first bring values into registers from memory (called LOAD)
  - Must store result of computation back into memory (called STORE)

## MIPS Load Instruction

Load Instruction is I-type

I-type: OP | rs | rt | 16-bit signed constant

`lw rt, imm(rs)`

## MIPS Store Instructions

`sw rt, imm(rs)`

## MIPS Memory Addresses

lw and sw read whole 32-bit words

- Addresses must be computed as multiples of 4. 

lb -> Used to load single byte
sb -> Store a single byte

## Storage Conventions

```
int x, y;
y = x + 37;
```

```
lw     $t0, 0x1008($0)
addiu  $t0, $t0, 37
sw     $t0, 0x100C($0)
```

## MIPS Branching

MIPS branch instructions provide a way of conditionally changing the PC to some nearby location

I-type: OPCODE | rs | rt | 16-bit signed constant

`beq` = Branch equal

`bne` = branch not equal

`bgt` = branch grather than

`blt` = branch less than

## MIPS Jumps

`j label` = Jump to label

`jal label` = Jump to label and store

`jr $t0` = Jump to address specified by registers content

## Multiply

Multiple: Product is twice as long!

If A, B are 32-bit long, A*B is 64bits

`mult rs, rt` = Multiply contents of registeres and store in pair of specifical registers {hi, lo}

hi:lo = $rs * $rt

Upper 32bit goes into hi, lower 32 bits go into lo.

To access results: 

mfhi = move from hi

mflo = move from lo

## Division

`div rs, rt` = Divide contents of register $rs and $rt, and store the quotient in lo, and remainder in hi

Unsigned versions:

multu & divu

## Factorial Program

```c++
int n, ans, r1, r2;
r1 = 1;
r2 = n;
while (r2 != 0) {
    r1 = r1 * r2;
    r2 = r2 - 1;
}
ans = r1;
```

Psuedo
```
t0 = 1
t1 = n
while (t1 != 0)
hi:lo = t0 * t1
t0 = t0 * t1
t1 = t1 - 1
Always loop back
ans = r1
```

MIPS
```
n:      .word 123
ans:    .word 0
...
        addi $t0, $0, 1
        lw   $t1, n
loop:   beq  $t1, $0, done
        mult $t0, $t1
        mflo $t0
        addi $t1, $t1, -1
        j    loop
done:   sw   $t0, ans
```

## Comparison

`slt` = set-if-less-than

`slt rd, rs, rt`

## Logical Instructions

AND, OR, NOR, XOR

and, andi

or, ori

nor

xor, xori

Examples:

`and $1, $2, $3` -> $1 = $2 & $3

## Pointers and Arrays in C

C vs Java

C has functions, Java has methods
- function == method without "class"
- i.e., a global method
  
C has "pointers" explicitly
- Java has them (called 'references') but hides them under the covers
- JVM takes care of handling pointers, so the programmer doesnt have to

C++ is soft of in-between C and Java

## What is a "Pointer" in C?

A pointer is an explicit memory address

Example: 

i : address 1056
p | 1056 | 2004

int i
- i is an integer variable

int *p 
- p is a variable that points to an integer
- p is lcoated, say at address 2004

p = &i
- the value in p is now equal to the address of variable i
- The value stored in Mem[2004]
