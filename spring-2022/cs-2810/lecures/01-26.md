## C/C++ 101

You can use gcc to compile a single .c file. Otherwise, you can create a make file and use `make` to compile a program with several files. 

Variables
```
int a = 0
int b = 0

int c = a | b;
int d = b;

d <<= b;
e |= d
```

## Homework

./btest -f <function name>

```C
printf("X: %i\n", x);

// %i = Integer. Same as %d. 
// %x = Hexidecimal

```
