## MIPS

Where are constants/immediates useful?

Small costances used frequently  (%50 of operands)
- In a C compiler (gcc) 52% of all ALU operations use a constant
- In a circuit simulator (spice) 69% involve constants
- e.g. B

## MIPS Register Usage Conventions

$0 is hardcoded to the value 0

MIPS machine has a 'frame pointer' to to point toward previous frame to see how much memory to remove from the stack

## Object Code

.o = object code file

```int t = x + y```

```add1 8(%ebp), $eax```
