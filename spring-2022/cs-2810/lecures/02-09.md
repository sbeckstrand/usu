## Alternate Disassembly

What can be disasssembled? Literally everything. Anything that can be interpreted as executable code. 

Disassembler exines bytes and reconstructs assembly code. 

## Integer Registers (IA32)

Total o f8 registers

%eax - accumulate, %ecx - counter , %edx - data , %ebx - data. %esi source index , %edi destination index, %esp - stack pointer, %ebp - base pointer

## Moving Data

movl source, data

Can be done with an immediat, a register, or memory

Source: immediate Dest: Register or Memory

Source: Register Dest: Register or Memory

Source Memory Dest: Register

## Simple Memory Addressing Modes

Normal (R) 
- Register R specifies the memory adderess

```movl (%ecx), %eax```

Displacement D(R)
- Register R specifies start of memory region
- Constabt displacement D specifies the offset

```movl 8(%ebp), %edx

## 64-bit registers
