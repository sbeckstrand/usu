All data types are just bits

```
Dec Hex Binary
0   0   0000
1   1   0001
2   2   0010
3   3   0011
4   4   0100
5   5   0101
6   6   0110         
7   7   0111
8   8   1000
9   9   1001
10  A   1010
11  B   1011
12  C   1100
13  D   1101
14  E   1110
15  F   1111
```

0x = Process as Hex
0b = Process as Binary

Hex can have 15 values per column. Once you get to 16, you roll to the next column. 

16 = 10
17 = 11
...
128 = 80
255 = 0xFF

print number as binary: 

```
unsigned char b = 0x10
cout << "B: " << std::bitset<8>(b) << end1;
```

Change the value at a specific bit: 
```
unsigned char a = 0b00000000;
unsigned char b = a | 0x01;
```

| = bitwise 'or'
& = bitwise 'and'
^ = bitwise 'xor'

```
A B A|B A & B   A ^ B
0 0 0   0       0
0 1 1   0       1
1 0 1   0       1
1 1 1   1       0
```

& and | can be used to set bit values based on initial input

XOR can toggle bit by original input
