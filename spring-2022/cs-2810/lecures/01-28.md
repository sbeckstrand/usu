## Make Files

A Makefile can be used to compile several files at once. 

You use a makefile to define how to build your application. 

`all` is usually the default target

Manual Targets: 

```

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -O -Wall
LIBS = -lm
btest: btest.c bits.c decl.c tests.c btest.h bits.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS) -o btest btests.c btest.c decl.c tests.c
```
