## Django

Python Web Framework.

Take an existing coding structure and we add our code to it.

### Pros

Django gives you a quicker route to your working app.

It guides you as you make your app, choices are made for you.

Batteries are included


### Django Cons

You give up a lot of control over how your project is organized

If your app isnt Djangos "shape", then Django gets in your way more than it helps.

Sometimes what you want is a solar panel, not a battery
