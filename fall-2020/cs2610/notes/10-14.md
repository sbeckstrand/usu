### Assignment 2

URL for specific entries: Up to us. Example: blog/entry/<key>

### Javascript

Can be included in an HTML file using the 'script' tag:

```HTML
<script src="path/to/script"></script>
```

Mutually exclusive. You cant point toward a source and do inline JS in the same script tag. Would need separate tags for this.
