## Electrostatic Energy

* It takes work to assemble a distribution of electric charges.

* That work is stored as **electrostatic energy** associated with the new configuration of charges.

* Each charge pair q_i, Q_j contributes energy U_ij = k(q_i)(q_j)/r_jk, where r_ij is the distance between the charges in the final configuration.
  * Example: Three point charges assembled to form an equilateral triangle:

  U_electrostatic = (k(q_1)(q_2))/a + (k(q_1)(q_3))/a + (k(q_2)(q_3))/a


## Capacitors

* A **compacitor** is a pair of conductors insulated form each other, and used to store charge and energy.
  * The two conductors are given equal but opposite chargers.
  * The work used in separating charge is stored as electrostatic energy in the capacitor.
  * **Capacitance** is the charge stored per unit potential difference: C = Q/V
    * It's SI unit is the **farad** (F): -F = 1 C/V
