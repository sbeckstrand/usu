### Exam 1

Currently 25 questions, will probably drop to 22.

### Chapter 23 Electrostatic Energy and Capacitors

* It takes work to assumle a distribution of electric charges.

* The work is stored as electrostatic energy associated with new configurations of charge.


First charge comes with no work. As new ones come in, we are doing work against the existing ones.

#### Capacitors

**Parallel-plate capacitors** - Has plates ?? Need to look into this.

F = Farad

#### Connecting Capacitors: Series

* Cpacitors connect in **series** are wired so that one capacitor follows the other.

  * The figure shows that this makes the charge on the two capacitors the same

  * The series capacitors, capacitance adds reciprocally: 1/C_series = 1/C_1 + 1/C_2 + 1/C_3, ...

#### Analyzing capacitor series and parallels

Example 3:

You have a 1.1 %backward y greek symbol%F and a 2.9 %backward y%F capacitor:

1) What values of capacitance could you get by connecting them in series?


2) What values of capacitance could you get by connecting them in parallel?


##### Example 4

1) Find the equivalent capacitance of the combination shown.

2) Find the charges on capacitors C1, C2, and C3 where a 12.0-V battery is connected across the combination.

3) Find the Voltages on capacitors c1, c2, and c3 when a 12.0-V battery is connected across the combination
