### What we are learning
* **Electromagnetic induction** which relates electric and magnetic fields.
* How to calculate induced emfs and electric currents using Faraday's Law
* Energy conservation
* Magnetic fields and how they store Energy
* Circuit elements called indcutors.

### Electromagnetic Induction
* **Electromagnetic induction** involves electrical effects (emfs and currents) due to changing magnetic fields.
* Simple experiments that result in induced current:
  * Move a magnet near a circuit.
    * If both are stationary, no current.
    * If magnet moves toward circuit, there is a current.
    * Faster moving magnet results in increased currents
    * Leftward moving magnet results in an opposite current.
  * Move the circuit near the magnet
    * If circuit moves toward magnet: There is a current.

* You can have electric currents on non-magnetic materials, such as aluminum.
