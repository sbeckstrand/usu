### Magnetic Field and Magnetic force

* The **magnetic field**, designated by 'B' exerts a force on *moving* electric charges.
  * The force depends on the charge q, the magnetic field B, the charge velcoity V and the orientation between V and B.
  * The magnitude of the force is given by: F = qvBsin(theta)
    * Its direction follows from the right-hand rule.
  * The magnetic force may be written in terms of the vector cross product: F = qv x B
