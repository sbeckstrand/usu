## Assignment 1: Data Collection

### Prompt 1:

---

A researcher wishes to do a comparative experiment to determine whether the flu shot is helpful in preventing the illness. He recruits a sample of 100 participants of all ages. Since many children don't like to get flu shots, he assigns all participants under the age of 18 to the control group (no vaccine) and the rest to the treatment group. He administers the vaccine to the treatment group in early fall. At the end of flu season, he compares the proportions in the two groups who came down with the flu.

##### Population of interest

World Population/All people

##### Parameter(s) of interest

If getting the flu shot helps to prevent getting the flu.

##### Observational study or controlled experiment

This is a controlled experiment as participants are assigned to groups based on their age. In this case, the group younger than 18 does not receive the shot where the other group does.

##### Why type of analysis does this anticipate?

Relationship between two statistics (number of cases in each group)

##### What problems are there with the sampling scheme?

There is a lot of clarifying information about the participants that could be helpful to insure there is not a bias. Such as the region each participant is from and their genders.

Also, I could be wrong but 100 total participants doesn't seem like a large enough sample size to make a concrete conclusion.

The poll shown here appeared on an online news site on Veran's Day 2019:

![Poll](../assets/img/assignment1-1.png)

##### Is 'US veterans' the likely population of interest? Why or why not?

No, population of interest would be anyone in the US, though they likely understand that veterans or those with a relation to veterans may have the strongest opinions.

##### Is 'People who visit the new site' the likely population of interest? Why or why not?

No, they are not. As mentioned, their population of interest would be all US citizens and their site is the means for allowing these people to vote.

##### Explain why the parameter of interest is not 'the people who think the US does enough for veterans'.

'The people who think the us does enough for veterans' is not a parameter because it is not a number. It is a general grouping of people.

##### Parameter(s) of interest

Parameters of interest are likely:
* How many people use the poll
* How many people think the US is not doing enough for veterans

##### Is this an observational study or a controlled experiment?

This is an observational study as the results of a poll/survey are being reviewed and there is not an attempt to directly affect the participants such as in a controlled experiment where one group would be imposed with a test of some kind that the other group is not.

##### What type of analysis does this anticipate?

Probably both Analysis for Numerical Data and Categorical Data? I say this because they will be observing the number of people responding to the survey (Numerical Data) and how many voted for each option (Categorical data).

Using a sample to estimate a population parameter (How many people think that the use is not doing enough for veterans )

##### What problems are there with the sampling scheme?

Typically news companies will have their own biases and posting a poll like this to their site would mean that their regular readers are most likely to account for most of the responses. This could result in a bias in answers.


### Prompt 3:

A marketing expert working for Macey's grocery store wishes to know the average number of times Macey's customers visit the store each week. In order to address this question, she chooses three different hours on Saturday during which she stands outside the grocery store and talks to customers as they enter to do their shopping.

##### Population of Interest:

Macey's Customers.

##### Parameter(s) of Internet.

Average number of times the customers she speaks to visit the store each week.

The number of customers spoken to.

##### Why is the parameter not 'The number of times each person visits Macey's in a week?'

Tracking visits for every single customer would be very difficult and its certainly not possible to gather this information just by talking to visitors for 3 hours on a single day. Instead, it seems likely that she is recording responses from the people she talks to during that 3 hour period to act as a sample and represent the rest of the customers as a whole.

##### Is this an observational study or a controlled experiment?

This is an observational study as she is not imposing anything on the visitors or splitting them into groups.

##### What type of analysis does this anticipate?

Using a sample to estimate a population parameter (In this case, the average number of times customers visit per week).

##### What problems are there with the sampling scheme?

Only speaking with people on a single day of the week could skew the results as its possible that the people who visit on Saturdays have different patterns than those visiting during other days such as weekdays. For example, those visiting on Saturdays may be part of the workforce or attending school or some other activity on weekdays that only allows them to visit on the weekends. Their visit behaviors would be different from those who can visit during the middle of the day on weekdays. One way to get a better sample may be to gather results over several weeks and speak with visitors on different days of the week and at different times of day.

I also think that these results could vary depending on the time of year when considering weather.

Additionally, performing this test during a pandemic would likely yield different results than if performed outside of it.

Lastly, I think these results would be most appropriately attributed to the specific Macey's store she is working with. I dont think this data could be said to be true about all Macey's stores as there would be other factors considering differences in weather in different regions, ethnicity majorities in that region, culture, etc.

### Prompt 4:

An arboriculturist (person who studies trees) wants to know if there is a relationship between the height of an apple tree and the number of apples it produces in a season. He chooses a random sample of 15 trees from a large orchard and records the heights of each tree and the number of apples produced during the most recent season.

##### Population of interest

Apple Trees

##### Parameters of interest

Height of each tree

number of apples produced during the most reason season.

##### Observational study or controlled experiment?

In this case, the sample trees are not being broken up into groups, where one group is having a specific condition applied to it. Instead, the behavior of 15 tree is being observed which makes this an observational study.

##### What type of analysis does this anticipate?

A relationship between two statistics (Height of trees and number of apples). This would be a correlation analysis.

##### What problems are there with the sampling scheme?

I don't think 15 trees is a large enough sample to make a conclusion about all apple trees, especially considering there are more than 15 varieties of apples and different types of trees could grow and behave differently.

### Prompt 5:

An animal behaviorist wants to know how exercise affects behavior of aggressive dogs. She finds a sample of 30 aggressive dogs and randomly divides them into three groups. Over one week, one group is exercised for 20 minutes per day, one for one hour per day, and one for 2 hours per day. The number of aggressive behaviors (lunging, biting, snarling, etc.) is recorded for the dogs in each group.

##### Population of Interest

Aggressive dogs

##### Parameter(s) of interest

Number of aggressive behaviors recorded

Length of walk per day

##### Is this an observational study or a controlled experiment?

This is a controlled experiment because the dogs are being split into three different groups and different treatment is being applied to each group.

##### What type of analysis does this anticipate.

A relationship between two statistics (Number of aggressive behaviors recorded and length of walk per day)

##### What problems are there with the sampling scheme?

It is not made clear what parameters a dog needs to meet to be considered an 'Aggressive dog'. It mentions that they are looking for behaviors such as lunging, biting, and snarling but are the dogs they are using in their sample regularly repeating these behaviors or would they have only had to show this behavior once? This is all to say that levels of aggression could vary between dogs and how they are selecting the sample could skew results. For example, if all dogs sampled show the same level of aggression, this may not represent all aggressive dogs accurately.

### Optional Prompt 1

You have been asked by a national dog adoption agency to collect data that represents the proportion of Americans that either currently own a dog or have previously owned a dog.

#### Prompt 1: Identify 3 ways to build a sample of people.

 Identify three different methods to select a sample that could reasonably predict the proportion of Americans that own or have owned a dog. You will need to look into sampling methods beyond those discussed in class. Explain how you would go about each of the three methods you came up with in some detail.


##### 1) Check with an existing research organization to see if they have collected data like this to used

My first step would be to check available public data from an organization such as Pew Research Center to see if they happened to have already done a poll/survey asking if participants had owned dogs.

##### 2) Utilize an online community/forum to poll a group of people.

To avoid regional bias I would consider creating a poll to be taken from strangers online in an online forum such as reddit. For example, there is a subreddit called r/SampleSize that exists with the intention of having people take surveys and polls for research purposes. There are 143K people subscribed to this subreddit, so it could help to build a decent sample size.


##### 3) Stand outside a public establishment and ask visitors that are willing to participate.

I know it wouldnt be the best approach but one way I could try to get more information than I currently have (which is none) I may resort to standing outside a public establishment such as a grocery store (assuming I am allowed to and have permission) and ask visitors if they have or have ever owned a dog.


#### Prompt 1: Compare the options

None of the methods I mentioned would have any/much cost outside of my own time.

If I was to use the first option of using existing data, it is likely to be the most accurate, but also lends to using data already used by others and not discovering new information. Also, depending on how old the information is, if it even exists, it may not be as helpful as newly collected data.

I think the first method would also help to avoid bias as it would be surveys taken by US citizens randomly selected.

I think using reddit could help to get a decent amount of information, but could be biased as the people in that community may not represent the nation as a whole as not everyone uses reddit and the site itself may attract certain personalities.

##### Prompt 1: Choose One

Of the three options I think I would probably create a survey on reddit (both to confirm they are a US citizen and to see if they owned a dog). I think this method would lead to the largest sample size as well as take the least amount of effort on my end. (If we are being completely honest).

### Optional Prompt 2

Find a research article on a topic that interests you, in which sampling from a population was used to gather data, and the article goes into reasonable detail about their sampling methods.

##### What is/are the population(s) of interest?

All people

##### What is/are the parameter(s) of interest?

Number of occurrences / Frequency of emotional, physical and sexual abuse as well as emotional and physical neglect before the age of 18

Number of sampled individuals in each group who were subject to abuse or neglect before 18.

Number of recent life events that contribute to stress

##### What was the sampling method employed?

Their study suggests that they recruited participants via "flyers and online postings". Of the respondents 93 were included in the study. To be eligible to participant, you had to meet the following criteria:

1) An individual with remitted Major repressive disorder (MDD)

OR

2) An individual with healthy control

They also determined eligibility of participants by performing an interview for genetic studies with the participant and one of their relatives (parent, guardian or close sibling).


##### Can you think of possible biases that could be introduced by the sampling method employed? If so, what are they?

It could be that focusing only on defined types of abuse and neglect could miss individuals who were emotionally impacted by things outside of what was being looked for. It seems that some things that impact one individual might not impact another and some people may show signs of trauma from events from things that may not be considered.

##### After reading through the sampling and analysis methods, how likely do you feel the researcher's conclusions are to properly represent the population of interest? What elements of their method give you the confidence (or lack thereof) in that representation?

Based on the steps they took I am confident in their result. As mentioned, it is possible that there are certain stressors or types of trauma that arent being included but I think the ones they selected would be traumatic for anyone and I think their study helps link how childhood adversity leads to depression in adulthood.
