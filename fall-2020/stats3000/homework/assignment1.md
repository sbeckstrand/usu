## Assignment 1: Data Collection

### Prompt 1:

A researcher wishes to do a comparative experiment to determine whether the flu shot is helpful in preventing the illness. He recruits a sample of 100 participants of all ages. Since many children don't like to get flu shots, he assigns all participants under the age of 18 to the control group (no vaccine) and the rest to the treatment group. He administers the vaccine to the treatment group in early fall. At the end of flu season, he compares the proportions in the two groups who came down with the flu.

##### Population of interest

World Population/All people

##### Parameter(s) of interest

If getting the flu shot helps to prevent getting the flu.

##### Observational study or controlled experiment

This is a controlled experiment as participants are assigned to groups based on their age. In this case, the group younger than 18 does not receive the shot where the other group does.

##### Why type of analysis does this anticipate?

Analysis for Categorical Data as they will be comparing the proportions of each group that get the flu before the end of the season.

##### What problems are there with the sampling scheme?

There is a lot of clarifying information about the participants that could be helpful to insure there is not a bias. Such as the region each participant is from and their genders.

Also, I could be wrong but 100 total participants doesn't seem like a large enough sample size to make a concrete conclusion.

### Prompt 2:

The poll shown here appeared on an online news site on Veran's Day 2019:

##### Is 'US veterans' the likely population of interest? Why or why not?

Yes. Although the question is opened to more than just US Veterans, they are the focus of the research and the population they are trying to draw conclusions about.

##### Is 'People who visit the new site' the likely population of interest? Why or why not?

No, they are not. As mentioned before, they are being poled but they are not the group that the news site is trying to draw conclusions about.

##### Explain why the parameter of interest is not 'the people who think the US does enough for veterans'.

The news site is likely poling to see how many people think the US is **not** doing enough for its veterans. Although the number of people who do think the US is doing enough is related, it is not the focus of the pole.

##### Parameter(s) of interest

Parameters of interest are likely:
* How many people use the poll
* How many people think the US is not doing enough for veterans

##### Is this an observational study or a controlled experiment?

This is an observational study as the results of a poll/survey are being reviewed and there is not an attempt to directly affect the participants such as in a controlled experiment where one group would be imposed with a test of some kind that the other group is not.

##### What type of analysis does this anticipate?

Analysis for Numerical Data as they will be observing the number of people responding to the survey and how many voted for each option.

##### What problems are there with the sampling scheme?

Typically news companies will have their own biases and posting a poll like this to their site would mean that their regular readers are most likely to account for most of the responses. This could result in a bias in answers.


### Prompt 3:
