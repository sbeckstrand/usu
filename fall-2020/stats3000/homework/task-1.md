# Task 1: Studies on the Web

Name: Stephen Beckstrand

Date: September 4, 2020

### Instructions

Search the internet for reports on at least two studies that are of interest to you. You should use two different sources for these. Study reports about on the internet. If you are stuck, you might consider: news sites, professional journals, Pew Research Center, Gallup.com. The ‘report’ need not be involved and could be as simple as a summary of the results.

For each study,
* Provide a link to the report
* indicate the question being investigated
* briefly explain how data were collected
* identify the population of interest (make your best guess if this is not explicitly stated)
* summarize the results
* indicate whether the study was well-designed and, if not, comment on what was wrong and how it could be improved.

### Study 1:

#### Title
Who are Adult Gamers? A Data Analysis By Platinum

#### Author(s)

Link: http://platinumparagon.info/adult-gamers-study/

##### Question(s)
Who plays video games? Of this group, who identifies as gamers? Are there different subgroups of gamers or are they a homogenous population?



##### Data collection

The data used in this article was actually collected by Pew Research Center. On the FAQ page of their website they clarify that they collect data by calling phone numbers of United States residents. Those who participate complete a survey asking questions to identify details about the participant as well as to answer questions about various subjects.  They suggest that everyone in the US has the same chance of being called.

In this case, 2001 (1012 Females, 989 Males) Americans participated in a survey asking questions related to videos such as to if games are a waste of time, promote positive qualities like teamwork and communication, etc.

The author of this study then used 'Pearson's correlation' to relate answers of the survey questions to those who indicated they play video games.

The data was collected between June 10 and July 12, 2015 and can be found at https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/ .

##### Population

All US residents with a phone number.

##### Results
Q1: Who plays video games?

925/2001 (46.2%) of the participants stated they play video games.

Q2: Who chooses to identify as a gamer?

Of the 925 who stated they played video games, only 165 (17.8%) identify as a gamer.


Q3: Are there different subgroups of gamers or are they a homogenous population?

"Older Gamers": Aged 42-77

More females than there are males. Mostly Democratic. Don't believe most gamers are male. Believe games are helpful. Don't believe games relate to violence.

"Younger Gamers": Aged 18-40

Mostly male. Mostly unmarried without children. Mostly Democratic. Believe most gamers are male. Believe games are helpful. Don't believe games relate to violence.

"Family Gamers": Aged 22-44 -

Mostly male (slightly). Most likely to have kids under 18. Almost evenly split democratic/republican. Believe games are helpful. Believe games relate to violence.

##### Study Design

I am not sure if age and/or background would play a factor in who would be willing to answer a phone survey. For example, I think someone who has participated in a higher education science class may be more willing to participate in a study based survey.

If it did play a factor (which I think is likely) that could skew the results since it may skew results, such as if it targets more students, employed adults in a higher paying field, etc.

Obviously these are things that can be checked, but I'm not sure if they are checked for balance here.

### Study 1:

#### Title:

##### Question(s)

Are depression symptoms more prevalent in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic than before?

##### Data collection

6506 US residents (5065 from before pandemic, 1441 during.) completed a survey distributed by NORC at the University of Chicago between March 31, 2020 and April 13, 2020. This survey aimed to gauge exposure to COVID-19, stressors, and current state of mental health.

##### Population

Whole US population with a valid address (Excluding those with only P.O. Box addresses)

##### Results

The prevalence of depression symptoms was higher in every category during the COVID-19 pandemic as opposed to before the pandemic. It is also suggested that higher risk of depression symptoms is associated with preexisting stressors such as having low income, not having $5000+ in savings, etc.

##### Study Design

To be honest, I cant find any fault with their study. I think they had a sufficient sample size and that the results are what most would expect. The study seems to have taken place as a confirmation.
