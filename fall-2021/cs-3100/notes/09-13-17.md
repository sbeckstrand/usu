## OS System Services

### Common OS Service Categories

#### User/ Developer View

#####  Interface

Three cores: 
- Command line (CMD)
	- terminal, shell
	- Popular
		- c-shell, bourne shell
		- bourne Again Shell (bash)
		- Korn Shell
		- z shell (zsh)
	- Often considered a special program. May need some other service to allow the use of a terminal
	- Main Purpose
		- Get and execute the next command
- GUI - Graphical User Interface
	- Very user friendly
	- Mouse, keyboard, monitor
	- Quick history
		- Xerox had the first GUI (Xerox PARC)
		- Apple Macintosh (1984) was the first computer to use GUI with mouse. 
- Touch
	- Relatively new
	- Mobile devices
	
	

Program execution

i/o operations

filesystem manipulation

communication

Error detection

#### System View

Resource allocation

Logging/statistics

Protection and security


### System Calls

Interface between running process and OS
	- API (Application Programming Interface)
	- Set of functions provided to a developer
Common
	- Windows API
	- POSIX (UNIX, Linux, MacOS)
	- Java
	- .NET
Example
	- fork - Create a child process
	- read - Read from a file descriptor

#### Implementation

One function call = many system calls

`cp in.txt out.txt`

Example system call sequence: Acquire input file name -> Write prompt to screen - Accept input -> etc

#### Passing Data

Passing parameters from a user mode called to a kernel mode function

Three Ways
	- Registers
		- Major limitation - registers are very small and very few
	- Blocks or tables
		- Pass an address to a register
		- Pro - Unlimited space for parameters
		- Slow 
	- Use a stack
		- User program push data
		- kernel service pop data
		
		
#### Types of System Calls

Process Control

File Management

Device Management
	- Request/release devices
	- read/write/reposition
	- attach/detach devices

Information management (About the system)
	- system data
	- get/set time
	- get/set process information
	
Communication Management
	- Creating/termination connections
	
Protection
	- Get/set permissions
	
## System Services

aka: System Programs, system utilities

Many times, its a wrapper for a system call

Categories
	- File manipulation
		- Create/delete/modify
		- Simple text editors
		- Search content
	- Status information
		- Getting system status
	- Programming/dev support
		- Compilers/Assemblers/Interpreters
	- Communication
	- Program loading and execution
	- Background services
		- Launched at boot time
		- Scheduling, disk checking
		- ak : services, subsystems, daemon
	- Interrupts
		- /proc/interrupts
		- `watch -n 0.1 -d cat /proc/interrupts`
		
## Why are apps OS specific? 

Different machine languages

Different system call structures
	- GUI is a big deal
	
Interpreted/VM
	- Bytecode > machine code
	
OS Design and Implentation
	- This is not solved. SO many different needs
	- GOals
		- User
			- Convenient
			- Easy to learn
			- reliable
		- System (Developer)
			- Easy to design
			- Easy to implement and maintain
			Flexible
			Error free, reliable
			Efficient
	- Conflicts
		- User wants fast >

### Mechanisms and Policies

Mechanism - How something will be done

Policy - What will be done (How mechanism will be used)

Example: 
	-Timer
		- Proect the CPU
		- Enables multi-programming

Anything with resource allocation


### Implementation 

How are we going to write it? 

Early operating systems were written in Assembly. Doesnt really have a compiler. 
	- Benefits of Assembly
		- Incredibly fast if used appropriately. 

High Level Languages
	- C/C++
	- Easier to port
	- Easier to maintain
	- Data structures/Algorithm for efficiency
	
### OS Structure

Just like any program. Properly organizing its content can make management easier. 

Monolithic Structure: Something that comes from one original location
	- Simplest Structure
	- All functionality is in a single addres sspace/single binary file
	- Single address space: 
		- Very Fast
		- Little overhead
	- Tightly Coupled System
		- Hard to maintain
		- Unexpected negative impact after changes
	- Pro - little overhead - very fast
	- Cons 
		- Difficult to maintain
		- Memory space overhead (unused drivers)
		- Difficult to implement
	

### Layered Structure


Loosely couple system - Separate into smaller components
	- Abstraction/encapsulation
	- Layer 0: Hardware, Layer n = user interface
	- Pro 
		- Simplicity of implementation (layer level) 
		- Debugging
	- Con 
		- Defining Layers is difficult
		- Communication overhead is huge
	- Not a common approach for OS.
	- Very common in network communication
		- TCP/IP stack. Has 7 layers.
