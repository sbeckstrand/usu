## Android Process Hierarchy

### Priorities

Forground processes - currently visible. 

Visible Processes - Not entirely visible. Used by a foreground process
    - EX: GPS, Excelorameter. 

Service Process - Performing activity apparent to the user. Not doing something for the foreground process, but it is something the user notices, such as streaming audio. 

Background Process - Performing activity that is not apparent to the user. 

Empty Process - No active components associuated with any application. 
    - Ex. Process to decide what other processes to kill

## Interprocess Communication (IPC)

Two types of processes
- Independent - Not affected by other processes, does not affect other processes
- Cooperating - Can affect, and be affected by other processes

Reasons
- Information sharing
- Synchonization
- Modularity - Simplicity of maintenance/implementation

Two approaches
- Shared Memory
    - A region of memory accessible by multiple processes
    - Procudcer/Consumer Paradign
        - Producer - creates data
        - Consumer - uses data
        - Can sometimes go both ways
    - Model
        - Shared buffer/array
        - Bounded capacity (Bounded buffer). aka: Limited amount of space we can use
            - Producer cannot add when full. Producer must wait
            - Consumer must wait when empty
        - Unbounded capacity/buffer
            - Producer can always add
            - Consumer must wait when empty
            - Network has something like unbounded capacity. 
        - Neither producer or consumer communicate directly
    - Concerns
        - Simultaneous access
- Message Passing
    - Send/Receive
    - Implementation Issues 
        - Physical/Hardware Support
            - Can actually be done through Shared memory
            - Hardware bus
            - Network
        - Logical Components
            - Buffer
            - Message Types
            - Passing Model (Direct/Indirect)
    - Issues/Concerns
        - How is the link established?
        - Are there more than two processes? 
        - How many links between processes?
        - Capacity/Bandwidh
        - Fixed or variable size messages
        - Uni or bi directional concerns
        - Buffered or non buffered
        - Blocking or non-blocking
 
## Direct vs Indirect Message Passing

### Direct

Processes know about each other

#### Properties

Single link established automatically

Exactly one pair of processes
    - Link between each pair

Typically bi-directional, can be unidirectional

#### Operations

Send(P, message)

Receive(Q, message)

#### Major Issue

Hard coding of process id information

### Indirect

#### Properties

Messages are sent/received to/from "mailboxes" or ports

Each Mailbox is uniquely identified

Processes can communicate if they share a mailbox. 

One linke/mailbox can be shared between many processes

Uni or bi-directional

#### Operations

send(A, message)
receive(A, message)

#### Major Issues

How is a receive handled? 

##  Sychronization

The behavior of send/receive actions

### Blocking Behavior

Synchronous behavior

Blocking send
- Sender is blocked until message is received
- Similar to a singing telegram

Blocking recieve
- Receiver is blocked until a message is available
- Similar to a bus stop

### Non-blocking behavior

Asynchronous

Non-blocking send
- Sender sends message and continues on
- Similar to dropping a letter in a blue mailbox

Non-blocking receive
- Receiver gets a message or null message
- Similar to blue mailbox pickup
