## Groovy

Gradle uses Groovy. 

Groovy offers a `doFirst` and a `doLast method`, as they are aptly name, blocks of code under the doFirst method will execute before your main block and doLast will execute after. 

```task base

base.doFirst {
	println 'base: doFirst'
}

task main (dependsOn:base)
main.doFirst {
	println 'main: doFirst'
}
```

Define `build.gradle` file. 

Define plugins

```
plugins {
	id 'java'
	id 'application' /* Needed for mainClassName property, also brings in the 'run' task */
}
```

Define source sets: (Defines where your source code is). Code will be under a directory called 'src'

```
sourceSets {
	main {
		java {
			srcDirs = ['src']
		}
	}
}
```

Define main class name

```
mainClassName = 'AssnXMain'
```

Define a jar (so it can be packaged to be run later)

```
jar {
	manifest {
		attributes 'Main-Class'
	}
}
```

Define jar file name

```
archivesBaseName = "AssnX"
```

All together: 

```java
plugins {
	id 'java'
	id 'application' /* Needed for mainClassName property, also brings in the 'run' task */
}

sourceSets {
	main {
		java {
			srcDirs = ['src']
		}
	}
}

mainClassName = 'AssnXMain'

jar {
	manifest {
		attributes 'Main-Class': 'AssnXMain'
	}
}

archivesBaseName = "AssnX"
```

You can remove your build folder at any time and it will not be a problem. It can be rebuilt. 

You can also run `gradle clean`

## Architecture (CPU)

### Multi-Processor System/Parallel System

#### Two Types of Systems

Asymmetric Multiprocessing

- Boss-Worker Model // There will be a question about this
	- One CPU that runs the kernel
	- The "boss" assigns tasks to other CPUs
	
Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)

- Each Processor can run any task, including OS tasks
- This tasks advantage of shared memory. 
	- This means also using a Shared cache. 

## Clustered Systems

Multi-CPU

Usually a compilation of computing systems. 

Shared Storage
	- Storage Area Network (SAN)
	
Uses:
	- High performance computing
	- fault tolerance/High Availability

## OS Operations

### Bootstrapping

Initial steps to starting a computer

Bootloader/boostrapper

Load the OS and needed drivers (for devices)

### Multiprogramming

Divide programs up into jobs/tasks/processes

### Multitasking (time sharing)	

 Switch between jobs very quickly (Such as interrupts)
 
### Dual-mode operation

User mode
	- Some instruction cannot be executed
	- Running user processes

kernel mode
	- all instructions may be executed
	- When running OS level processes

User Process: User process executing -> Calls system call -> Execute system call (kernel) -> Return from system call (back to user Process)

Overhead
	- Expense that we occurr to accomplish a task
	- Processed using an interrupt (to change the mode)
	- Cost is 1000's of cycles on the CPU (quite extensive, takes a bit of time). 
	
	
## CPU Timer

Countdown for the current process (What is running on the CPU)

Operating system determines when a processes CPU time is done, not the program itself. 

When process timer ends, trigger an interrupt to switch processes



## Resource Management

### Process Management

Process - Program in execution (not necessarily on the CPU). AKA: task, job

What we are referring to here is managing resources that the process needs. 
	- CPU
	- Memory
	- I/O
	- Files
	- etc. 

Multi-CPU system
	- Synchronize resource management between CPUs
	
OS Responsibilities
	- Create and Delete
	- Schedule and Resume
	- Process communication
	- Process synchronization



### Memory Management

What should be in memory and where

How much memory a process gets

### File System Management

### Mass Storage Management

OS Responsibilities
	- Mounting and unmounting storage devices
	- Free space management
	- Disk scheduling
	- Partitioning
	- Protection
	
### Cache Management

Remember, Cache is temporary storage

Magnetic Disk -> Main Memory -> Cache -> Hardware register

### I/O Subsystem Management

Hide device communication needs from user

Memory management
	- Buffering
	- Spooling - mixed processes
	- Caching
	
	
## Protection and Security 

Protection - any mechanism for controlling access to processes or OS resources

Security - Defense against internal and external attacks

Security Triad - CIA 
	- Confidentiality - Keep data private
	- Integrity - Ensuring data is correct, authentic, and reliable. 
	- Availability - Data is accessible to authorized users at authorized times
	
## Computing Environments

### Traditional Computing

Evolves over time

Workstations

Thin Client 

Remote work

### Mobile Computing

Primary way for many

Email, Messaging, Word Processing

Web/social

### Distributed Systems

- Physically separate systems working together (networkd together)
- Shared file system
- Connected via
	- LAN - Local area network
	- WAN - Wide area network
	- MAN - Metropolitan area network

### Client Server computing

- Client generates requests
- Server processes and returns answer
- WWW

### Peer-to-peer

Nodes in the system are not distinguished from each other

As peers, each node can perform client or server like operations. 

### Cloud computing

SaaS (Software as a service)
	- Google office, Office 365
	- Many many more

Platform as a Service (Paas)
	- AWS - amazon web services
	
### Real-Time Embedded Systems

Something like a stop light. Something that performs actions but without much interaction. It is just embetted. 

Time Critical

Internet of things
