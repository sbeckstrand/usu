## Relational algebra. 

Algebra working with 'tables', which are just sets. Which has the implication that they do not have order. 

Selection (sigma): Select all columns but filter rows by what is selected
- Does not change the schema

Projection (pi): Only output values in selected column(s). 
- Can, and often does, change the schema

Union: Output single relation with unique values from the two unioned relations
- both relations MUST have the same number of columns

Difference: Output a single relational with only rows unique to the two relations being used. 

Cartesian Product: All possible pairings of all multiplied tuples

Intersection: Output tuples with common values. 
- r - (r - s)
